<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In the following letters, written during a stay of
nine months in the Philippine Islands, I tried to
convey to those at home a faithful impression of
the country I was in and the people I met. Since
I came home I have been advised to collect and
prepare certain of my letters for publication, and
this I have done to the best of my ability, though
with considerable misgivings as to the fate of such
a humble little volume.</p>

<p>It is impossible to mention the Philippine
Islands, either in daily life in the country itself,
or in describing such life, without reference to the
political situations which form the topic of most
conversations in that uneasy land. On this subject
also I wrote to the best of my power, faithfully
and impartially; for I hold no brief for the
Americans or the Filipinos. I merely aimed at a
plain account of those scenes and conversations,
generally written within a few hours of my
observing them, which, it seemed to me, would
best convey a true and unbiassed impression of
what I saw of the Philippines as they are.</p>

<h1>AN ENGLISHWOMAN IN THE PHILIPPINES</h1>

<h2 id="LETTER_1">LETTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">MANILA</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, <i>27th November 1904</i>.</p>

<p>We arrived here early yesterday morning from
Hong Kong, after three days of rather a horrible
sea voyage, as the steamer was more than crowded,
the weather rough, and we carried a deck cargo of
cattle. These conditions are not unusual, however,
in fact I believe they are unvarying, as the
362 miles of sea between here and Hong Kong
are always choppy, and the two mail steamers
that ply to and fro, the <i>Rubi</i> and the <i>Zafiro</i>, are
always crammed full, and invariably carry cattle.</p>

<p>The poor beasts stood in rows of pens on the
main deck, each fitting tightly into his pen like a
bean in a pod; many of them were ill, and one
died. We watched the simple funeral with great
interest, for the crew hoisted the dead animal by
means of a crane, with a rope lashed round its
horns, standing on the living beasts on each side to
do it; but they had a good deal of difficulty in
extracting the body from its pen, in which it was
wedged sideways by two live neighbours, who
stubbornly resented the whole affair. Finally,
with a great deal of advice and swearing, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
carcase was slung over the side, and it looked very
weird sailing down the ship’s wake in the
sunset.</p>

<p>That was the only event of the voyage, till we
sighted Luzon, the biggest and most northern of
the Philippines, some time on Saturday afternoon—this
is Monday, by-the-bye.</p>

<p>The <i>Zafiro</i> kept all along the coast, which
loomed up dim and mountainous, but we could
not see anything very clearly, for the atmosphere
was thick and hazy. Here and there on the
darkening mountain sides a column of smoke rose
up very straight into the evening air, and I was
told they came from forest clearings, but we saw
no signs of human habitation. A man who had
been many years in the Philippines, and was
returning to what had become his home, told me
that such fires on the mountain sides had been
used a great deal as signals between the insurgents
during the Spanish and the American wars, and had
been made to indicate all manner of gruesome
messages.</p>

<p>About two in the morning, the <i>Zafiro</i> arrived
at Manila and anchored in the bay, and when it
was light, about five o’clock, we came up on deck
and looked round, but the land lies in a section of
so vast a circle that one does not realise it is a bay
at all. The morning was very dull and grey; hot,
of course, but overcast, and the sea calm and grey
like the sky. The city of Manila lay so nearly
level with the water that it was almost out of
sight, just a long low mass, rather darker than the
sea. Far, far away inland a faint outline of
mountains was perceptible, but Manila is built,
for the most part, on a mud-flat at the mouth of
a broad river called the Pasig. This is a curious
river, only 14 miles long, coming from a big lake
called the Laguna de Bayo, but yet it is wide and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
deep enough at the mouth for 5000-ton steamers to
anchor at the wharves and turn in the stream.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock, or earlier, our friends’
launch came out for us, and in this little craft we
steamed up the mouth of the Pasig, past rows and
rows of steamers anchored at the quays, and
hundreds of huge native barges covered over with
round roofs of brown matting. I noticed numbers
of brilliantly green cabbages floating down the
stream, sitting on the water like lilies, with long
brown roots trailing behind, and thought a cargo of
vegetables had been wrecked, but was told these
are water plants drifting down from inland bays up
the river. They are the most extraordinary plants,
of intensely crude and violent emerald, and make
a marvellous dash of colour amongst the grey and
brown shipping on the yellow, muddy water.</p>

<p>We landed at a big wharf, right in the town, and
close to streets with shops, all looking strangely
European after China and the Straits, the whole
place reminding me more of the suburbs of Malaga
or the port of Las Palmas than any other places I
can think of. Here a carriage was waiting for us,
and we drove all through the outskirts of the
town, till we came out upon the bay again, and
saw the open sea, where our friends’ house is
situated in a quarter called Ermita. All Manila
is divided into quarters, or wards, with curious
Spanish or Filipino names—Malate, Pasay, Intramuros,
Binondo, etc., and many names of Saints.</p>

<p>The days get very hot here after eight o’clock,
whether the sun happens to be shining or not, so I
did not go out until the cool of the evening, and
spent the day in the house, unpacking and resting,
and trying to forget the smell of those cattle.
Never again, I am sure, shall I linger with pleasure
near the door of a byre!</p>

<p>Everyone here goes about in diminutive victorias,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
very like the Italian <i lang="it">carrozza</i>, and all the horses
are tiny ponies, the result of a cross between the
little Chinese horse and a small Spanish breed.
They are sturdy little beasts, and remarkably quick
trotters, with thick necks, and look pretty if they
are well kept; but some of those in the hired
carriages are very poor little creatures, though
they tear about with incredible loads of brown-faced
natives.</p>

<p>We drove about the town, which all looks as if
it had been put up in a hurry. There are no
indications of antiquity outside Intramuros, the
old Spanish Manila, founded in 1571, which stands,
as its name signifies, within walls—crumbling
grass-grown old walls, very high, and with a deep
moat.</p>

<p>This Walled City, as the Americans called
it, is the town the British took under General
Draper in 1762, and these are the walls our ships
bombarded at the same time, under Admiral
Cornish, papa’s great-uncle. When we were at
home, it seemed strange that just before I came to
the Philippines, I should inherit the lovely old
emerald ring which the priestly Governor of Manila
gave to the Admiral, when the former was a
prisoner of war in the British Fleet, during the few
days we held the Philippines, before we gave them
back to Spain. But when I was actually under the
walls they fought for, I looked at the old ring, and
the coincidence seemed stranger still. I wished it
were a magic emerald that I could rub it lightly,
and summon some mysterious spirit which would
tell me all the old ring had seen and heard. But now,
Old Manila is only a backwash leading to nowhere,
for the modern town has spread itself all up the
banks of the Pasig River.</p>

<p>Our way did not lie through the Walled City,
but along outside it, down a broad avenue, bordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
by handsome trees, over a bridge across the Pasig,
and into the town of shops and streets. The whole
place looked dull, grey, ugly, and depressing, and
after Hong Kong it seemed positively squalid.
Big houses like the magnificent stone palaces of
Hong Kong, would be impossible here on account
of the frequent earthquakes, but such buildings as
there are look mean and dilapidated, and the streets
are badly paved or not at all, weeds grow everywhere;
in fact, there is a sort of hopeless untidiness
about the place that is positively disheartening, like
going into a dirty and untidy house. I think
a great deal of the hopelessness, too, consists in
the air of the natives, who appear small and
indolent after one’s eye has become accustomed to
the tall, fine figures of the busy Chinamen.</p>

<p>I was particularly struck with the fact that I
saw no traces of anything one is accustomed to
think of as Spanish—no bright mule-trappings,
or women with <i lang="es">mantillas</i>, or anything gay and
coloured, and the houses are not built round <i lang="es">patios</i>.
I was told that the reason of this is that the
Spaniards who settled in the Philippines all came
from the north of Spain, from Biscaya, and of
course the Spain one knows and thinks of <em>as</em>
Spanish is Andalusia and the South, with the
wonderful glamour and poetry of the Moorish
influence.</p>

<p>In the course of our drive we went to a certain
bridge to see a religious procession, and as we got
near the place where it was to pass, the streets
were crowded with people, and there were triumphal
arches scattered about, all looking quite pretty in
the rosy-pink glow of the sun, which was just
beginning to set. We pulled up in a mass of
carriages and traps on one side of the bridge, and
waited an hour or more for the procession, which
was then about three hours overdue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>While we waited there, we met and talked with
a Mr —— whom I mentioned to you before as
having come out from England in the same series
of steamers as ourselves. He told us that he was
putting up at the best hotel in Manila, which, he
said, was haphazard and dirty beyond belief. We
said we had had the same account from other
people, and considered ourselves more than lucky
to be staying with friends.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “you are in luck, for you can’t
imagine what a Manila hotel is like. And yet it is
full of decent people. I wonder why they can’t run
a better one.”</p>

<p>It does seem odd when one comes to think of it,
because, though Manila is off the tourist track of
the world, and there is no reason for any mere
traveller to come here, still, people do come sometimes,
and anyhow there are the Americans themselves,
who want a shelter of some sort, and that
nation has the reputation of being accomplished
connoisseurs in the matter of hotels. One would
imagine that a good hotel would be the first thing
they would demand or establish, but they have
been here six years now, and the Manila hotels are
still a byword for unutterable filth and discomfort.</p>

<p>Well, about this procession, the occasion of which
was the bringing down to Manila of a very sacred
image, called the Virgin of Antipolo, from the town
of Antipolo, which is inland, to deposit her in some
church in Manila. She had been four hundred
years in Antipolo, and was a very precious and
much-battered relic, so her journey was a great
event, and the procession had been travelling, by
road and river, ever since before the dawn.</p>

<p>At last the long lines of people began to appear,
crawling over the bridge in the last grey shadows.
It proved to be a very dull affair, simply consisting
of endless files of the faithful, carrying unlighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
candles, with every now and then a band of
music, and every now and then a group of paper
lanterns carried on poles, or some gaudy banner,
and all moving along to the accompaniment of a
weird, unearthly chant. This kind of thing went
on and on, and after an hour we got tired of it, and
drove away without having seen the actual image,
which was, we were told, a little, armless, wooden
figure, dressed in a stiff tinsel robe, perched up on
an immense high platform, decorated with lamps
and flowers, and surrounded by priests chanting,
and acolytes swinging censers.</p>

<p>We are to sail for Iloilo to-day, after lunch,
having got a permit to go in the <i>Kai-Fong</i>, of the
China Steam Navigation Company. We were
to have come in this same steamer from Hong
Kong, as I told you at the time, in which case we
should have gone in her right through to Iloilo,
touching here and at Cebú, but we received the
telegram too late, an hour or so after she had left,
and as we were told to start at once, we followed
by that pleasing craft the <i>Zafiro</i>.</p>

<p>By this manœuvre we have clashed with a
vexatious local law that forbids foreign (<i>i.e.</i>, not
American or Filipino) steamers to convey passengers
from Island to Island of the Philippines, so we had
to apply for this special permit, as they say the
regular mail steamers, which ply between Manila
and Iloilo, are exceedingly dirty and uncomfortable.
They are owned by a Spanish Company, trading
under the American flag. However, it is all settled
now, in favour of the English boat, and we sail this
afternoon.</p>

<p>I have only caught a passing glimpse of Manila,
but I hope to be able to tell you more about it
later on, as I have been invited to come back and
pay a visit to our friends here in a month or two’s
time.</p>

<span class="smaller">FROM MANILA TO ILOILO</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">S.S. “Kai-Fong,” China Sea</span>, <i>December 1, 1904</i>.</p>

<p>I hear there will be a mail going out from Iloilo
to-morrow, the day we arrive, so I will write you a
letter to go by it, that you may not be disappointed—six
weeks hence!</p>

<p>We left Manila at three o’clock on Monday, in
lovely sunshine, and had a delightful voyage through
scenery which was simply a miracle of beauty. The
sky was intensely blue, with little white clouds;
the sea calm and still more intensely blue, dotted
with dreams of islands, some mauve and dim and far
away, some nearer and more solid-looking, and a
few quite close, so that we could see the great
forests of bright green trees and the grassy lawns,
which cover the hills and clothe the whole islands
down to long, white, sandy beaches, with fringes of
palm trees.</p>

<p>The islands are volcanic, mountainous, and of
all shapes and sizes, from Luzon, which is nearly
the size of England,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Mindanao, which is
larger still, down to tiny fantastic islets, but all
rich, green, fertile—even a rock poking its head
out of the brilliant sea, has its crown of green
vegetation. I don’t know at what size an island
ceases to be an island and becomes a mere rock,
but anyhow, there are two thousand Philippines
considered worth enumerating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>I noticed very few signs of cultivation, or even
of human habitation, but was told that even if
there were villages in sight, they would be difficult
to distinguish, unless we passed close to them, as
they are built of brown thatch, and placed amongst
the trees. Here and there was a little group of
white buildings, generally, in fact always, clustering
round a huge church. We passed quite close to
some of the islands, so that we saw the trees and
beaches clearly, but even those at a distance were
very distinct, and I was particularly struck with
the absence of colour-perspective, for the islands
some way off, if they were not so far away as to
look mauve, were just as brilliantly green as those
close at hand. One after another, like a ceaseless
kaleidoscope, these fairy islands slipped past all day—in
fact, as I write, I can hardly keep my
attention on my letter, the scenery is so wonderful
and so constantly varying.</p>

<p>We got to Cebú, which is the chief town of the
island of that name, at six o’clock on Wednesday
morning, and anchored just off the town, which
appeared as a flat jumble of grey corrugated iron
roofs and green trees, rather shut in by high
mountains close behind. On account of these hills,
they say Cebú is much hotter than Iloilo, as the
latter town lies open to the Monsoons.</p>

<p>These are the chief towns of the Philippines:
Manila, the capital, in Luzon; Iloilo, in Panay;
and Cebú, in Cebú; and that is the order they come
in as to size, though between the two provincial
towns there is endless rivalry on the subject of
importance. In fact they are a sort of local
Liverpool and Manchester—bitterly jealous, and
yet pretending to despise each other. There was a
P. and O. cargo steamer anchored not far from us,
the first ever seen at Cebú, and everyone seemed
very proud of the event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>When we went on deck, we saw a couple of
canoes, hollowed out of big tree trunks, circling
round, and containing natives dressed in loin-cloths,
offering to dive for coins, in the approved fashion,
west of Port Saïd. They were fine young men,
yellowy brown in colour, and they made a great
deal of noise, but did not dive very well. After
breakfast some of C——’s friends came off in a
launch and took us ashore, when we drove in the
usual little victoria, drawn by two small ponies, to
the British Vice-Consulate, a large house on the
borders of the town, where the Vice-Consul, Mr
Fulcher, entertained us royally.</p>

<p>Here I followed the same programme as I did
at Manila, resting in the cool house all the long,
hot day, and driving out in the evening at about
five o’clock, when the sun had begun to go down.
We drove all through dim streets, with a gorgeous
sunset fading in the sky, and I could not make
things out very distinctly, but could see that we
were passing along ramshackle, half-country roads
with overshadowing trees, and every now and then
we passed a row of little open shops with bright
lights in them, and natives squatting about. There
are no bazaars in this country, by-the-bye, only
little mat-shed shops where food is sold.</p>

<p>That was all I saw of Cebú, as I did not go out
this morning, and we sailed in the afternoon. When
we came down to the wharf to get on board, the
tide, or the Port Doctor, had allowed of the <i>Kai-Fong</i>,
drawing up to the wharf, so we came on
board up a plank, when one had to look at the
ship instead of the water on each side! The ship
was very busy getting a cargo of hemp into one of
the holds, hemp being the peculiar produce of the
Island of Cebú and the opposite ones of Samar
and Leyte, all long-shaped islands lying almost
parallel in the middle of the Archipelago.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus1">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="600" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Discharging Hemp from Paraos (Native Boats).</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_10"><i>To face page 10.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The hemp comes on board in great oblong
bales, looking like oakum, and a man told me it
was the fibre of a plant like a banana tree, which
the natives split and shred very skilfully, and then
it is dried and done up in bales, and “that is all
there is <em>to</em> it,” as the Americans say.</p>

<p>Opposite the town of Cebú is a long, low island
called Mactan, where the great Portuguese Navigator
Magellan was killed in the year 1521. The
story is that the natives of the islands, finding
Magellan invincible, and believing him to be
enchanted, lured the great explorer away by
treachery to the little island of Mactan, where they
had prepared a pit covered with branches, such as
they use to trap wild pigs. Magellan fell into this
trap, whereupon the savages rushed out of their
hiding-places and shot him in the joints of his harness
with poisoned arrows, and one bold man finally
finished him off with a spear. They poison their
arrows to this day as they did then, by dipping
the tip into a decomposed human body.</p>

<p>There is a monument to Magellan on the spot
where he died, but we did not have time to go
and see it, so I had to be content with looking at
a photograph, which gave me a very good idea of
the quaint old three-decker edifice of grey stone,
tapering to a column at the top. The real and
original spelling of Mactan is as I have written it,
but it is now altered to Maktan, and for this
change there is a very curious reason, dating from
the days, some ten years ago, when the Filipinos,
headed by a patriot of the name of Emilio
Aguinaldo, revolted against the authority of Spain.
The chief element in the uprising was a secret
society, called the Katipunan, the device of which,
on flags and so forth, was K K K, and to make
this fact memorable, or to prove his power,
Aguinaldo ordered the hard letter C to be replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by K in all names in the Philippines, making
Mactan, Maktan; Capiz, Kapiz; Catbologan,
Katbologan, and so on. This alteration the
Americans, some think unwisely, have not taken
the trouble to abandon, so the revolutionary
spelling remains a monument of the success of
disloyalty, to say nothing of the names having thus
lost all philological significance.</p>

<p>We are now passing round the north end of the
Island of Cebú, for Panay lies to the westward,
in a rough parallel. Sometimes the north passage
is taken, and sometimes the south, according to the
wind and current. The currents are very strong
between these islands—all the Philippine Islands,
I mean, and in many places the sea is always
rough, in fact it is very seldom really calm
anywhere, I believe.</p>

<p>Our fellow-passengers are all Americans, half
of them military, officers and privates, who address
each other in most unceremonious fashion, and
the rest school-teachers. A most appropriate and
characteristic company, as the American scheme
out here is to educate the Filipino for all he is
worth, so that he may, in the course of time, be fit
to govern himself according to American methods;
but at the same time they have ready plenty of
soldiers to knock him on the head, if he shows signs
of wanting his liberty before Americans think he
is fit for it. A quaint scheme, and one full of the
go-ahead originality of America.</p>

<p>I can understand the conduct of the free and
easy soldiers, for such equality is not inconsistent
with American social theories; but what puzzles
me is the use of these astounding pedagogues, who
are honest, earnest, well-meaning folk, but their
manners are those of ordinary European peasants.
And as to the language they speak and profess, it
is so unlike English that literally I find it difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to catch their meaning when one of them speaks
to me direct, and quite impossible when they talk
to each other. Yet I could forgive them their
dreadful lingo, if only they would not use the same
knife indiscriminately to lap up yolk of egg, or help
themselves to butter or salt. Of course these good
people are fresh from America, and utterly ignorant
of all things and people outside their native State
(such ludicrous questions they ask!), but quite
apart from that, and the hopeless blunders they
must make on that account, it seems a pity
that such rough diamonds should represent to these
natives the manners and intellect of a great and
ruling white nation.</p>

<p>But here comes the most curious phenomenon
of all, for I am told that the United States does
not pose as either “white” or “ruling” in these
islands, preferring, instead, to proclaim Equality,
which seems a very strange way to treat Malays,
and I find myself quite curious to see how the
theory works out. I only hope it won’t mean that
we shall have unmanageable servants and impudence
to put up with. Our friends in Manila
told me ominously that housekeeping was “difficult,”
and I begin to wonder if Equality has
anything to do with it!</p>

<p>They are a funny little people, these Filipinos,
the women averaging well under 5 feet, with
pretty, slender figures and small hands and feet.
The original race was a little, fuzzy-headed, black
people, remnants of which are still to be found in
the mountains and in the smaller islands, but the
Filipino, as one sees him, is the result of Malay
invasions. Up in the north, in Luzon, the Malays
are a race or tribe called Tagalo, but all this part
of the Archipelago is called Visaya, and the people
Visayans. Of these broad outlines there are many
subdivisions of type of course, in the way that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
physique is different even in different counties in so
small a space as England; but the average Filipino
is the same everywhere. The Filipinos (by which
are meant the Tagalos and Visayans) are, as nearly
as one can say, a short, thick-set people, with
yellowy-brown skins, round, flat faces, very thick
lips, which frequently jut out beyond the tip of
the nose, and more bridge to the same said nose
in proportion to the amount of foreign blood
in the owner’s veins. It is not easy to lay down
any very definite rule about their appearance
though, as the race is so hopelessly mixed with
Spanish, Chinese, European—every nation under
the sun, that it is difficult to say what is a Filipino
face. One feature they have in common, and that
is magnificent, straight, jet-black hair, which the
women turn back from the forehead, where it
makes a roll so thick that it looks as if it must be
done over a pad, while they twist the back high
up, in shiny coils. The men look as if their thick
mops were cut round a basin, and they have no
beards and moustaches—I mean they can’t grow
any, not that they don’t want them! As far as
I have seen, they appear to be very lazy, and to talk
a great deal. They are not a bit like the Chinese
or Japanese in any way, unless they happen to have
a strain of that blood in them, and even then the
resemblance is only physical, for though the type
may be varied, the universal character remains
unalterable.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that at Cebú we “collected”
C——’s dog, a dear old brown person,
with one of the sweetest faces I ever saw, who
answers to the name of Tuyay, which is the
Visayan for Victoria. I really must leave off
writing now, as it is long past time to “turn in,”
though I feel as if I could write on for hours, there
is so much to tell you.</p>

<span class="smaller">FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF ILOILO</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>December 4, 1904</i>.</p>

<p>We arrived here on Friday last (the 2nd), and I at
once sent off a letter to you, written on board the
<i>Kai-Fong</i>, which letter ought to reach you some
time in the middle of January.</p>

<p>We are so glad to be at the end of this long
journey—exactly seven weeks from London—seven
weeks to the very day, for we left London
on a Friday and got here on a Friday; and all
that time we have been travelling steadily, and
have seen so much that it seems years already
since we left home. I hope you got all the letters
I wrote on the way? One each from Gibraltar,
Marseilles, Port Saïd, Aden, Colombo, Singapore,
Penang, Hong Kong, Manila, and lastly, Cebú.
I give you this list because I always have a fixed
conviction that letters posted on a sea voyage seldom
turn up, as the last one sees of them is going over
the side in a strange land, in the clutches of
some oily, dark person, who swears he will spend
the money one has given him in stamps. I
try to believe him, but he, like Victor Hugo’s
beggar, thinks he has to live somehow, I suppose.</p>

<p>Well, so here we are at last on our “Desert
Island,” as you call it—which is really a vast and
fertile country, with several big towns, of which
this is the chief and largest.</p>

<p>We got in at dawn as usual, the run from Cebú
(which I notice the Americans call <em>See</em>-boo) being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
about twelve hours, so our first view of the Island
of Panay and the town of Iloilo was in the early
morning light, from the deck of the steamer, which
lay, waiting for <i lang="fr">pratique</i>, in the “roads,” at the
mouth of a river. We saw a long, flat, dark-green
coast line, with a high range of purple mountains
far inland, and the town of Iloilo, like Manila, almost
imperceptible, as it lies so low on the mud-flats of a
big estuary. It did not look at all inviting, just a
line of very green trees, with some grey iron roofs
amongst them, and it seemed as if it must be baking
hot, but, as a matter of fact, the very flatness and
the direction of the mountains keep the place cool,
for, as I told you before, it lies exposed to the N.-E.
and S.-W. Monsoons, the great arbiters of fate in
the China seas.</p>

<p>On the map you may find marked a small island
called Guimaras, which is about 4 or 5 miles off,
but in this air it looks so close that trees and houses
can be seen over there with the naked eye, and
yesterday evening, in driving down a street of
Iloilo and seeing Guimaras at the end, I thought it
was part of <em>this</em> island at the end of the road!</p>

<p>Guimaras is very small, with low, pointed hills,
covered with forests, as are all these islands; and
behind it, 7 miles further away, lies the big
island of Negros, the mountains of which loom up,
a dim, pale purple outline behind bright green
Guimaras, making one more of these marvellous
colour effects. One of the high peaks we see is a
volcano called Malaspina or Canloon, which is 4592
feet high, and only half quiescent. At any rate, if
we cannot actually see it, there is such a volcano
in Negros. There are plenty of volcanoes in the
Philippines, twenty-three of them all told, and
that fact and the frequent earthquakes give an
uncomfortable impression, as of a thin crust of
rocks and trees over vast subterranean fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, in Panay, the mountains are 20 miles
inland, away to the west—a long range of peaks
and serrated ridges, behind which the sun sets with
magnificent effects. From the foot of the mountains
the land stretches away quite flat, watered by big
rivers, and where one of these streams forms a
wide estuary, this town is built, as I told you, on the
mud, in the same way that Manila stands on the
mud-flats of the Pasig.</p>

<p>The first settlement of white men in Panay was
only a Spanish garrison, inside a fort built in the
days when a few Spaniards in armour lurked under
shelter from the poisoned arrows of the savage
natives, while now and then a priest ventured out to
see what a little talk and baptism would do towards
making life more pleasant for everyone concerned.</p>

<p>When the island became more civilised, or
settled, or subdued, or all three, a town called Jaro
(pronounced Hahro) was founded about 3 miles
up the river, and became the capital of Panay, but
now the tide of commerce has swept down-river,
and the chief town is Iloilo, all crammed down at
the edge of the sea, with many of its suburbs
nothing more nor less than sandy beach. It is a
big town, with long, straggling streets, and the
houses, all two stories high, with grey corrugated
iron roofs, stand apart, separated by little bits of
garden with palms and flowering trees, which
makes it quite pretty, in spite of all the buildings
being totally devoid of any architectural beauty
whatsoever.</p>

<p>At present the N.-E. Monsoon is blowing, and
everyone is anxious to point out to me how
deliciously cool the weather is, and it is certainly
not so overpowering as I had expected, but all the
same I find it quite hot enough to be pleasant
and a little over. Though there is no dew, the
nights are refreshing—almost cold by contrast with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the day, and the evenings charming, while the early
mornings are simply delicious. Dawn begins at
half-past five, and by six the sun is up, but the air
is exquisite till about half-past eight, when it begins
to get too hot for anything but shade and fans, if
one has any choice. I think the average Fahrenheit
now is 83°, but as life here is adapted to such
temperature, you must not think that means anything
like what 83° would be in England. Still, when
all is said and done, it is very hot, and if this is
what they call “winter,” I am only thankful that I
have not plunged at once into “summer.” This
“winter” goes on till March, and then the weather
begins to get hotter and hotter till June, when the
Monsoon shifts to the S.-W., and the rainy season
begins.</p>

<p>Four months dry and cool; four months
dry and hot; four months wet and hot—that
is the climate over most of the Philippine
Islands, but it varies in sequence in different
places—areas is a better word—and on the Pacific
seaboard the seasons are quite reversed, so that it
is rainy there when it is dry here. By rain and dry,
however, I gather that a great deal of drought or
a long, steady rain is not meant, for all during the
dry season there are heavy showers, and everything
remains green, while in the wet season there are
spells of fine weather. Now I think I have
described to you all I can of Iloilo till I see
more of the place, but I know how anxious
you will be to have some idea of what it is
like.</p>

<p>We are busy house-hunting, which is a tedious
and toilsome business, as there is not such an
institution as a house agency—you allow a rumour to
get about that you want a house, and then people
tell other people to tell you where an empty
building, such as you say you want, is to be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Then you go off and “find” the house—a matter,
usually, of infinite difficulties and sometimes quite
impossible, as the Filipino cab-drivers don’t know
the names of the streets, or the numbers, or the
names of the people. The best plan is, get into
a rickety old trap and let the man drive about,
while you lean out and ask for the house you
started out to find, and end by seeing another
one with <i lang="es">se aquila</i> (to let) written up, and stopping
as near to it as the driver can pull up his pony, and
getting out there instead.</p>

<p>Having thus “found” a house, you set to work
to “find” the owner of it, who is probably at
the club, or a cock-fight, or playing cards; and
when he, or she, appears, you ask—and this is
quite necessary—if the house is to let; for the board
does not signify much, as they seldom take the
trouble to remove one when once it has been put
up. Most of the boards are obligingly going
through the process of removing themselves, one
nail at a time.</p>

<p>When the house really is to let, you ask the
rent, and whatever the answer is you throw up
your hands in horror, and declare it is <i lang="es">muy caro</i>
(very dear), and that you will give half, calling
assorted Saints to testify to all the drawbacks
which make the house unfit for human habitation
at any price.</p>

<p>Then a long argument ensues, for the people
never really want to lose a tenant, as they know
there is no lack of choice, for trade is very bad,
and so many houses stand empty. All the same,
the rates and taxes are appallingly high, and the
rents are preposterous for this sort of town, and
for the accommodation offered. Moreover you
have a strangely lazy, supercilious, half-bred sort
of people to deal with, who would rather keep a
house empty and say they must have 100 dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a month and starve, than take 50 for it and live
on the fat of their land.</p>

<p>The money here is a dollar currency called
Conant, which is worth 2s. 1d.—half the American
dollar. This is the Philippine currency, and is
named after its inventor, an American called
Conant, and I wish he had invented a cheaper
unit, for 10 Conant dollars, or <i lang="es">pesos</i>, as they
are called, are nothing to spend, whereas the equivalent,
an English guinea, is an important sum, and
represents four times the spending value of 10
<i lang="es">pesos</i>. It is a silver currency, dollars and notes,
and the coins have rather a pretty design of a man
sitting looking at the sea, surrounded by most
amusing inscriptions. For instance, the 5-cent,
piece is: “Five Centavos,” and underneath is
“Filipinas.” Why not “Five cents.” and “Philippines,”
or else “Cinco centavos, Filipinas?” Why
such mongrel? One can only suppose it is the
notion of Equality coming out in some mysterious
way by meeting the natives half-way in Spanish,
which, by-the-bye, is not their native language, and
only a few of them speak it at all.</p>

<p>The houses here, as I said before, are all two-storied,
the upper part of wood, and the lower of
stone or concrete. The floors are of long planks
of hard, dark, native woods, which the servants
polish with petroleum pads on their feet, sliding
about till the surface is like brown glass. The
walls are merely wooden partitions, painted white
or green, and in the corners of the rooms appear
the big tree trunks to which the house is lashed,
sometimes just painted white like the walls, or
encased in a wooden cover. The word “lashed,”
I must tell you, is not a figure of speech, as the
houses really are tied together with <i lang="es">bejuco</i>, rattan
(a strong, fibrous vine), so as to allow sufficient
play for earthquakes, which, it appears, are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
frequent in these islands as to be in no way
remarkable.</p>

<p>The “windows” are really the greater part of
each side of the house left open and fitted with
shutters, sliding in grooves. Even with these
“windows” closed against rain or sun the rooms
remain cool, as the shutters are composed of
wooden slats a little apart. Inside these is another
set for very rainy weather, made of small square
panes, each filled with a very thin, white, pearl oyster
shell.</p>

<p>Taken all round, the Philippine houses are
very pretty, and capable of a great deal of decoration,
though, of course, one does not want any
draperies or many ornaments about in such a climate,
where such superfluities would simply become the
homes and nurseries of clouds of mosquitoes and
other small fry, besides being unendurably hot
even to look at.</p>

<p>At first it appears very odd to see houses
without chimneys and rooms without fireplaces,
though I can’t think why they have none, as it
must be very difficult to keep the houses dry in
the wet Monsoon.</p>

<span class="smaller">A PHILIPPINE HOUSE—AMERICAN PRICES—NATIVE
SERVANTS—FURNITURE</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>December 10, 1904</i>.</p>

<p>I am sure you will be pleased to hear that we have
already found a house to suit us, in fact we are
quite charmed with it, and can’t be too thankful
that we did not hastily take any of the others we
saw. C—— went to look at some on Tuesday, but
on the way he saw this one, and liked it so much
that he at once came back for me to look at it,
and I went off to inspect, even in the middle of the
day! I agreed with him in thinking the house
charming, so we took it at once—or as soon as we
had finished the preliminary pantomime with the
Filipino landlady, a pleasant woman, married to a
Spaniard.</p>

<p>The house is in one of the two nicest streets, a
little out off the town, on the spit of land formed by
the estuary and the open sea. These two streets
run parallel, but as the spit gets narrower they
leave off, and end in the Government Hospital,
the Cavalry <i lang="es">Corral</i> (stables), some Government
buildings, and diminish gradually to a long road,
a house, some barren land, a few palms, a pilot’s
hut, a little bit of beach, some pebbles, and one
small crab.</p>

<p>Our house faces S.-W. on a garden, and the back
is all open to the river and the N.-E. Monsoon—the
most important consideration here, for houses that
do not get the wind are stifling and unhealthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
We saw two or three that would have suited us
very well, but for the fact that they stood the
wrong way, or because the through draught was
impeded by some tree or building outside.</p>

<p>The house we have taken is in the usual style,
such as I described to you in my last letter, and in
one-half of the lower part lives our Spanish landlord,
while in the other half, rather vault-like, <i lang="es">se
aquila</i>. The lower parts of the houses are unhealthy,
because of the malarial gases arising from
the soil, and the damp, so no one lives in the
basements if they can afford anything else.</p>

<p>The upper part of this house we are going to
live in is quite a separate dwelling, as it is
approached by an outside staircase, coming up
upon an open balcony running round three sides of
the upper story. The balcony is a great charm,
and very few of the houses have this addition. I
thought that the Spaniards would have made open
balconies the fashion out here, but was very much
surprised to see none, and can only attribute the
lack of them to the fact that the settlers came from
the North, in the same way that the houses have no
<i lang="es">patios</i>, and so forth. A roofed balcony like this
is not only a delightful lounge, but it keeps the
house very cool, besides catching a lot of the heavy
rains, and it seems incomprehensible that any sane
person could build a house in this climate without
one. Verandahs are, of course, quite unknown,
but I daresay there is a reason for all this in the
terrible Typhoons which sweep over these islands,
and would make short shrift of any fancy out-works.</p>

<p>We come into a big hall at the back of the
house, with the outer side almost all (with shutters)
open to the estuary, and the front portion of the
house is the <i lang="es">sala</i>. Off these two, open five rooms,
all large and airy, and freshly painted white. In
many of the houses the top of each room has a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
frieze in the shape of a pretty wooden grill, a
Chinese fashion, which allows the air to circulate
freely through the house—to say nothing of the
remarks of the dwellers! We have not got this
extra luxury, which I suppose has not been considered
necessary in so airy a house.</p>

<p>At the back is what is called the <i lang="es">Azotea</i>, which
in this case happens to be built over the house
below. It is a big, sloping, concrete floor, on which
are built the kitchen, bathroom, store-room, etc.—all
very compact, and quite away from the house,
and not coming between us and the wind. In this,
again, some of the houses we saw were impossible,
for the outbuildings on the Azotea were placed so
that they stopped the draught through the house.
You may think I am a little foolish on the subject
of a current of air, but I assure you I am not, for
in a position with no draught the pores of the skin
open like so many sluices, and one’s head begins to
throb.</p>

<p>So that is our house, which, after genuine
Spanish haggling, we got for 50 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a month, a
sum working out at about £60 a year, a very low
rent indeed out here. In fact, when we set out
and said we meant to give no more than 50 dollars
a month for a house, we were simply laughed at,
and at first were almost inclined to think it could
not be done, but when we saw the numbers of
houses standing empty in all the nice streets, we
stuck to our sum, and are very glad now that we
did so. A Spaniard or <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> (Eurasian) would
not dream of giving more than thirty for a house
like the one we have taken, but an American would
give a hundred. That is where the trouble comes
in—in making the people understand that we don’t
mean to grind them down, nor, on the other hand,
to pay foolish sums, but to give the right value for
what we get.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>You know the way Americans go about in
Europe spending the unit, which is lower than
their own, like water, with no sense of value?
And how they raise prices wherever they go!
Well, they have done the same thing here, and an
American woman, who was talking to me the other
day, told me it was now beginning to be apparent
to them what a mistake they had made, and they
bitterly regretted having made the Philippines as
expensive as America, but that it was very difficult
for them to go back now to the more reasonable
scale, for as soon as a Filipino found out you were
an American, nothing would move him from
American prices. Poor thing, she was very bitter
about it, and I felt very sorry for her (as well as
rather alarmed for myself), for the sums she was
paying in rent and wages to live at all in Iloilo,
would have kept her in comfort in London or Paris.</p>

<p>Well, when we had settled on the house, we
drove straight to the shop-streets of the town—or
rather, street, for there is only one with shops, the
principal thoroughfare, called the Calle Real. Some
of the shops have quite big, handsome windows of
plate glass, with wonderful things displayed in
them, but when you get inside you find they are,
like the shop window in Browning’s poem, only
“astonishing the street,” and beyond the window
there is nothing but a large half-empty hall, where
a few languid, sallow Eurasians stand trimming
their nails behind long, untidy counters. These are
the Spanish, Filipino, and German shops; but the
Chinese are just the reverse, with no show in the
little low window, and the inside a small, poky
room, crammed with everything any human being
ever invented, and kept by energetic, slant-eyed
men who simply won’t let you go without buying
something.</p>

<p>The principal shop, however, is the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Store, which is kept by an English firm called
Hoskyn &amp; Co., and is said to be the best in the
islands, and there we bought elemental necessaries,
in the way of a few pieces of furniture, some
groceries, china, glass, and so forth, at prices, when
translated into shillings, to turn one faint with
dismay. It was maddening to think of the lovely
things we could have got for the same money at
home, nevertheless these were very cheap for the
Philippines, for this is a notoriously cheap “store,”
which can afford to sell at low prices, as they
have such an immense business, even being able to
compete with the shops in Manila, where they send
all manner of life’s necessaries. Though I am once
more reminded of papa’s remark that he never
realises what a curse human life has become till he
reads through a store list.</p>

<p>When we had done our shopping, we came
back to the house and unpacked our new household
goods as they came in, hung lamps, and so on,
and all that day worked hard at the house. At
intervals prospective servants kept dropping in, for
servants are secured here in much the same way
as houses—people tell other people about the
opportunity, and the news flies about in servant-land.</p>

<p>All shapes and sizes of Filipinos loomed on the
balcony at intervals, and drifted into the hall and
stood watching us till we had time to attend to
them. In this country all the doors stand always
open for coolness, and there are no bells, and when
you go to a house you walk in at the door and sing
out for a servant. Some people go so far as to
have a hand bell at the top of the stairs, but the
whole system seems to me ridiculous, so I have
persuaded C—— to invest in a door bell, which he
is going to fix to the main door into the hall.</p>

<p>We were unpacking and going about the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and every now and then we would come upon a
silent figure waiting, just waiting, anywhere, leaning
up against something, and perfectly indifferent to
time or place. This stamped him as a candidate.
To each one C—— put first of all the question:</p>

<p>“Can you speak English?”</p>

<p>And when the man said “Yeees, sair,” he was
refused without any further parley, for nothing
will induce us to take servants who can understand
what we are saying, which would make
life impossible in these open houses. Besides
that, when they speak English it means they
have been with Americans, who spoil the
Filipino servants dreadfully with their well-meant
notions of equality, and give ridiculous
wages as well. In the Spanish days a Filipino
head-servant got 5 or 6 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a month, and
the <i lang="es">peso</i> then was the Mexican dollar, which is
only about two-thirds of the Conant unit. It
was, and is, riches to them, but so changed are
these things now, that we are considered wonderful
because we have found a <i lang="es">mayordomo</i> or head boy
willing to come to us for 10 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a month and
a second boy for 6. An American would give
them twice as much, if not more, which would
simply turn them into drunkards, or gamblers,
or both, or worse.</p>

<p>All the Philippine servants are men, as all
over the East, though some women do have
a native maid; but as all the women I have met
do nothing but complain of the laziness and
uselessness of these handmaidens, I have no
idea of saddling myself with such a burden.</p>

<p>The two men we have engaged are about
twenty years of age, but it is always very difficult
to tell how old Filipinos are, as they look old
when they are young and young when they are
old. They can give no particular account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
themselves, these two, and have unaccountably
mislaid their little books of references; but we
are taking them on the recommendation of their
faces, which are nice, and that is just as good
a standard to go by in a Filipino as in anyone
else! One is a native of Guimaras; the other
a Tagalo, from Luzon; and both are short,
thick-set, sturdy-looking fellows who ought not
to give us much trouble with falling ill. Half
the time here the servants are ill with fever, or
colds, or heaven knows what, for it is a race
without much stamina.</p>

<p>One of the most aggravating characteristics
of the Filipinos is the way they murmur, for
they have naturally very soft voices, which
become positively a whisper with shyness and
awe. The English people here adopt the custom,
which prevails throughout the East, of calling
their servants “boys,” but the Americans use the
Spanish word <i lang="es">muchacho</i>, and that is unfortunate,
as they give all vowels the narrow, English value,
making it this word <i lang="es">muchaycho</i>. It sounds so
odd, this lack of ear, and quite alters some of
the Spanish names—such as saying Cavyt for
Cavite (the naval port of Manila), Caypiz for
Capiz (a town in Panay), and so on, and though
they pronounce Jaro exactly the same as the
English town of Harrow, thank goodness they
don’t go so far as to call this place Eye-low-Eye-low!</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_28"><i>To face page 28.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>But I am wandering away from the servants,
and I have not yet introduced the cook to
you. We had less trouble to get this treasure
than the others, as all the natives cook well by
instinct—at least, they know how to make the
best of what food there is to be had, which
is all one wants. This particular <i lang="fr">chef</i> is a
shrivelled, pock-marked person, about 4 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
6 in height, with an array of immense teeth,
and an air of intense importance; this last characteristic
being funny or annoying according to
the mood one happens to be in oneself. His
wages are 15 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a month, and as he is a
married man, or says so, he is to live with his
family in the town.</p>

<p>And that was the end of the first day, and
a very long and fatiguing one in this climate.</p>

<p>When we came back next morning we found
that the <em>boys</em>, who had been left in charge of
the house and what furniture we had fixed up,
had already swept and polished the floors, which
made an immense difference to the appearance
of the place, and the lamps were filled and
trimmed. There is electric light in the town,
but it is so very bad, and is the cause of so much
complaint, that all have to supplement their expensive
electricity with oil lamps before they can read.
We are, therefore, not going to have it put on,
though it would be quite easy, as the wire passes
over us from next door. The efficiency and intelligence
of the new servants pleased us very much,
but all the same we observed cautiously to each
other: “New brooms sweep clean.”</p>

<p>We left the new brooms still sweeping, and
went off to the shops again, and once more spent
important and heart-breaking sums on the bare
necessities of life. This time it was furniture, at
the shop of a Chinese Eurasian, where we got
a lot of things that look very nice, though they
are not anything wonderful in the way of wood;
but in these light, open houses with no fires
and no carpets, it is not necessary to have
such rich-looking furniture as at home. If one
likes to spend still more money, there are beautiful
things to be had made from magnificent hard
Philippine woods, but the high price of labour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the poverty everywhere, and lack of capital and
enterprise, have made these hard-wood things
so dear that they are luxuries. The ordinary
furniture is, in spite of the cent.-per-cent. import
duties, either made out of Oregon pine, or else
imported ready made from Vienna; but an insect
called <i>buc-buc</i>, with which the country abounds,
eats these soft pine woods, though it will not
touch the native mahogany, teak, ebony, etc.
It is not as if this Philippine timber were swept
off for export, for no trade is done with it as
no cheap labour is to be had, and splendid trees
just decay in the crowded forests on the hills.</p>

<p>For our <i lang="es">sala</i> we invested in basket furniture,
a necessity in this heat, for padded chairs or
cushions would be unendurable. The bamboo
and rattan, of which Chinamen would make all
sorts of pretty chairs and couches for a few <i lang="es">pesos</i>
a piece, grow plentifully here, but in the Philippines
such articles are only to be had at three
times the price, as they are imported from China,
for the Filipinos are too lazy and stupid to
make anything of the materials given them by
“<i lang="es">el buen Dios</i>,” and if they did, the scale of
wages, set by the American Government,
would make the things even more expensive
than those imported. So the reeds rot, and the
woods rot; and we, for our part, cannot cease
to regret that we did not, while we were in
Hong Kong, invest in some of the cheap and
beautiful furniture we saw there, but we took
local advice and forbore to import anything into
this land of prohibitive tariffs; though now we
discover that, tariffs and all, we should have
found it cheaper to have brought the things
with us.</p>

<p>All this expense of life springs from the
accepted interpretation of the maxim, “Philippines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for the Filipinos,” which saying was invented by the
late (and first) Governor-General of the Philippines,
a man of the name of Taft, who is now Secretary
of War in the United States. I suppose the idea
caught on in America, and the good people there,
whose opinion controls affairs in this country, which
they have never seen, think that prohibitive tariffs
and the exclusion of cheap Chinese or Japanese
labour, must be a good thing for these depopulated
islands if it is a benefit to the overcrowded U.S.A.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, when applied to an indolent,
indifferent race, the result is stagnation and
starvation prices, which is a terrible state of
affairs in a hot country like this, where food
and labour ought to be plentiful and cheap, or
nothing will pay. I can’t think that the Americans
really believe the Filipinos to be as high a development
of the human race as they are themselves;
but since they wish, with the best intentions,
to allow the Filipinos to benefit by American
systems of government, these Malays must first
learn the A B C of such a system. Whether
they are capable of profiting by such lessons,
or whether they are so foreign to the essence
of this race as to ruin it, remains to be
demonstrated.</p>

<p>Well, I must get back to the house again, and
the end of the story is that we moved into our
house on Thursday, the 8th, and slept here that
night. We were able to do this so soon, as people
have been very kind in lending us things—sheets
and towels from one, table-linen from another, and
so on—but all the same I wish our cases would
come, as there is such a responsibility about other
people’s gear.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">À propos</i> of these same cases, we are rather
uneasy in our minds about them, as we are beginning
to hear alarming rumours of Customs duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to be paid. Wedding presents used to be exempt,
but quite lately duties were levied on them, and
I am afraid we shall have to pay for our own
things, which is a bore, not to say rather a blow.</p>

<p>We got through all our trunks, etc., that we
had with us with a perfunctory opening of one
box, a few questions, and the signing of papers,
the only trouble being C——’s gun, which they took
away, and he will not be able to get a licence, or
allowed to have it out of the Customs House
before he finds two “bonds” of 100 dollars each.
That is, in clear English, he must find two
people who are prepared to bet the American
Government 100 dollars each that he is not
going to sell the gun to an Insurgent.</p>

<p>So, barring the gun anxiety, we got our boxes
in all right, and are told it would have gone equally
well with the cases had we had them with us, but as
they are coming out by freight, they will be subject
to the duties. However, the authorities tell us it
will not be very severe—C—— went and inquired
about it, as he said he would rather not take our
spoons and forks and things out of bond, but would
prefer to send them back to Hong Kong rather than
pay a large sum. So, all things considered, C—— is
not reassured, so he has arranged to have the cases
sent here unopened and in bond; and is going to
open them, in bond, at the Custom House, and have
the contents appraised before he decides what to do
with them. The only reasonable hope is that
many of the contents, such as plate, may be exempt,
or very lightly taxed, as they are articles that could
not possibly be produced in the Philippines; but
when I mentioned this to a Customs official, he
replied that such an idea had nothing to do with
the system of taxation.</p>

<p>This is a fearfully long letter, but even now I
feel I have not told you half I wanted to.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_5">LETTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOUSEKEEPING IN ILOILO</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>December 17, 1904</i>.</p>

<p>We are settling down very comfortably into our
charming house, which we like more and more,
and are continually congratulating ourselves on
our luck in having found such a nice home.</p>

<p>There is nothing special to tell you about since
I last wrote, so I will try to give you some idea
of my housekeeping, of which I think I have not
yet told you anything beyond just mentioning how
many servants we have.</p>

<p>I find that the cook—he with the important
manner and the big teeth—has been an under-cook
in an American hotel, or what he is pleased to
call an American hotel, by which I take it he means
one of the saloons or eating-houses in the town.
So far, however, he has proved himself a very good
cook indeed, which is even more necessary here
than anywhere else, for food in the Philippines
has but little variety, and is not nourishing at its
best. Every morning I give this person a <i lang="es">peso</i>
and a half, with which he goes off to the market
and buys whatever takes his fancy, or, more probably,
what is to be had, which generally takes
the form of an incredibly small and thin fowl—alive;
one or two little fish; some green
peppers or egg-plants, and always a few very small,
half-ripe tomatoes. With these and with help
from the store-room, he concocts a very good lunch
and dinner, and, doubtless, makes a good thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
out of it, but most cooks charge 2 dollars for
the same <i lang="fr">menu</i>, and he really provides for us very
well. I supply tea, salt, butter, lard, tinned fruits,
potatoes, macaroni—in fact all the dry provisions
usually kept in a store-room, I don’t know what
is the technical name for them.</p>

<p>The store-room (<i lang="es">dispensa</i>, they call it), where
these treasures are hoarded up, is a very nice little
dark cabin, with shelves all round, which I made
the boys clean out and wipe everywhere with
petroleum, an excellent precaution against the numberless
and extraordinary animals with which one
has to share the house. I got tall glass jars for
protection against cockroaches, and tins to keep
mice off, and wire-netting for rats, and naphthaline
to astonish the scorpions and spiders; and last,
but by no means least, a good strong padlock for
human beings! When the tins and bottles were
all arranged, they looked very home-like.</p>

<p>We get up at half-past five or six, and I
give one of the <i>boys</i> 20<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> cents, with which
he goes out and buys bread for the day at the
shop of some Chinaman down the street. It is
necessary to get small daily supplies of everything,
for food will not keep. Some people
have told me fearful anecdotes about the horrors
perpetrated by the Chinamen in the making of
their bread, and these faddists have theirs made
at home, but the Chinese bread tastes quite good,
and is much more light and digestible than that
made by the house-cooks. As our cook has
cooked for Americans, he knows how to make
the hot cakes which are the great feature of
American breakfasts, but we won’t have them, for
they are deadly anywhere, especially in the tropics.</p>

<p>After our seven o’clock breakfast, which consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
very largely of eggs, and after C—— has
gone to the office, I open the door of the <i lang="es">dispensa</i>
and serve out the day’s supplies; but this routine
was not brought about without a struggle, for
at first the cook persisted in coming to me intermittently
all day long to ask for things. At
least, he invented wants, but I had an idea his
only object was the key of the <i lang="es">dispensa</i>, as these
Filipinos have a full measure of the cunning of
the brown-faced person all the world over.
However, I disappointed him about that, always
leaving whatever I was doing to go and open
the door and get out what he wanted, at the
same time remarking, as best I could, that if
he did not ask for things at the proper time
he must do without them. Then once or twice
I carried the threat into effect, and when he
heard what C—— had to say about the dinner, that
cured him. Everyone tells me doleful tales about
the way the <i lang="es">muchacho</i> or <i>boy</i> robs them, so I
thought it would be better to start from the
first by giving as few opportunities as possible
for trouble of this sort.</p>

<p>In the morning the servants’ food is also
given out, each one getting an allowance of rice
(for which purpose we lay in a large sackful),
and this they boil and eat with some tiny fish which
they buy for themselves with a few extra cents
I give them. I believe it is unheard-of extravagance
to give the extra money; and I never
measure out the rice, but let them take it, for,
after all, it is all the poor souls live on. All
over the Philippines the natives of all classes
live almost entirely on rice, which formerly used
to be grown in all the islands, but rinderpest
destroyed many of the <i lang="es">carabaos</i> (buffaloes), which
worked the soil, and high wages and heavy taxes
have wrought even greater havoc, so that now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the supply nearly all comes from China. You
see, high wages are offered in the towns,
and what with that and the unsuitable education
they receive, the country-people all flock into
the towns, and the country places are empty.
It is on the coast, in the towns, that rice is so
much eaten, for inland the staple food is <i lang="es">camote</i>
(sweet potato); so the country-people think rice
a luxury, and the town’s-people eat <i lang="es">camote</i> as a
treat.</p>

<p>When I wrote last, I don’t think the staff
was completed by the washerwoman, was it?
A person with a huge, almost black, pan face
came and stood in the picture of blue sky and green
palm-branches framed in the doorway, dressed in a
skirt formed of a tight fold of red cloth and a
muslin bodice with huge sleeves (the native
costume), holding a big black umbrella in one
hand, and muttering in an undertone, while she
kept one dull, rolling eye on Tuyay, who was
disposed to growl and sniff.</p>

<p>We were at breakfast at the time, and as
we ate we conversed patiently with her till we
found that this person wanted to be taken on
as a <i lang="es">lavandera</i> at 20 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a month, which
is about twenty-six guineas a year. This offer
we refused with imprecations, and we added that
we would not give more than 10.</p>

<p>She melted away, murmuring, from the front
door, and presently reappeared at the back
door (both opening upon the hall, but at different
ends), and murmured afresh. I must tell you, by-the-bye,
that, following a very general custom
here, we use one end of the hall as dining-room,
though there is a room which has been used for
that purpose, but it looks on the alley between
this house and the next, and is not so cool as
the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>After more conversation, we decided to engage
this pan-faced individual at 12 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a month
as a stop-gap, till we should be able to find some
more intelligent woman, and there and then I gave
her a bagful of soiled linen, and off she went.</p>

<p>Next day at lunch she suddenly reappeared,
perfectly cow-like and stolid, leaning up against
the door-post and murmuring so that C—— simply
got <em>wild</em> with her, and would have thrown everything
on the table at her head, I believe, if I had
not been there.</p>

<p>As the cook is the only one of the servants
who speaks above a whisper, he was sent for, and
he told us that pan-face wanted soap, starch, and
charcoal. All the washing is done in cold
water at some well, it appears, and they only want
a little charcoal to put in the iron. So C——
wrote an order, a <i lang="es">vale</i> they call it, upon Hoskyn’s
for soap, a box-iron, starch, and charcoal, and away
went the new <i lang="es">lavandera</i>.</p>

<p>But we had not seen the last of her, for
the next day she came again, at breakfast this
time, and murmured again, clutching the bulgy
gamp and leaning against the door-post. This
time the cook told us she wanted tin tubs,
and C—— gave a sort of roar as he asked her when
the devil she was going to begin the washing, but
she only looked more hopelessly stupid, and her
face became more like a gorilla’s. At last she got
her <i lang="es">vale</i> for tubs, and off she went—but about
mid-day she reappeared, on the balcony, outside
the front door, with the tubs, huge tin baths,
sitting beside her.</p>

<p>C—— managed to control himself sufficiently
to ask her if there was anything the matter with
the tubs, and she was understood to say no, but
she only wanted to show us she had got tubs;
and she melted away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Next afternoon I was told the <i lang="es">lavandera</i> had
arrived, so I went out to tell her the <i lang="es">señor</i> would
soon be in and ready to listen to her, though I
really had some doubt about the latter statement,
but I found her undoing a huge bundle of washing—all
finished and ready! And such beautiful work,
C——’s white linen suits done to perfection, my
frocks and blouses like new—I never saw clothes
look more fresh and lovely. It was a pleasant
surprise.</p>

<p>So pan-face remains, but all the same we are
quite prepared to find this standard not kept up
for long, and if any remonstrance has to be made,
we know we shall have that blank look and that
murmuring to face again.</p>

<p>The <i>boys</i> are shaping very well, and if they go
on as they are doing, no one could wish for better
servants. I did not bewilder them more than I
could help at first, but sprang a routine on them by
degrees in a mixture of pantomime, Italian and a
word or two of Spanish, that seems to answer the
purpose very well. Two things C—— insisted on
from the first: one, that the servants should wear
native costume and bare feet in the house; and the
other, that they must address us as <i lang="es">señor</i> and
<i lang="es">señora</i>, none of which little marks of etiquette are
insisted on in American households, but we think,
and I believe rightly, that they are of the greatest
importance in dealing with Orientals. C—— said
if they didn’t like these rules they could go,
but apparently they did like them, and they have
stayed.</p>

<p>We asked some friends to dinner a few nights
ago, and just before they arrived C—— went into
the hall and found an unknown young man, in a
very smart, white, buttoned-up, linen European suit
with starched collar, and white canvas shoes, standing
on a chair in the middle of the hall, doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
something to one of the lamps. When the man
turned round, we saw, to our amazement, that he
was Domingo—our second <i>boy</i>!</p>

<p>When he saw C——’s expression, the servant
was quite frightened, not having any idea what
crime he could be committing or have committed,
but he very soon understood that if he did not take
off those shoes and that coat he would be fired
out of the house. I don’t think the poor creature
meant any harm, in fact he was supposed to
be got up in his best to do honour to our
guests, but he fled at once to the Azotea, and
has never been seen again except in the Filipino
dress, which is a loose shirt rather like a Chinaman’s
coat, only fastening up the middle, and with
bare feet.</p>

<p>Yesterday the cook appeared, carrying four huge,
tall orchid plants, with very green leaves and pale
mauve flowers, such lovely things, which he suggested
would look well in the <i lang="es">sala</i>, and I quite
agreed, so we began to negotiate for them. The
countryman who had brought the flowers was
ushered to the back door, and there was understood
to murmur that he wanted 2 <i lang="es">pesos</i> (four shillings)
for the four plants, but the cook, who said this was
<i lang="es">muy caro</i>, got him down to a <i lang="es">peso</i> and 20 cents;
only, the people here use many terms applicable to
the old coinage, such as <i lang="es">real</i>, <i lang="es">peseta</i>, and so on,
which make it so extremely puzzling to discover
what the price of things really is, that I found it
difficult to make out what to give; but the cook
fished out a <i lang="es">peso</i> and 20 cents out of a pile
of money I put on the table, and the man picked
the two coins up and went off quite content. In
my ignorance, I thought it rather a shame to
insist on so low a price for such lovely plants—and
orchids, too! However, I have since
found out that these plants grow wild in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
profusion in the woods over in the Island of
Guimaras, and that what I had paid was like
giving a man at home two shillings for a bunch
of primroses. In spite of this, I decline to consider
myself swindled, or to be dissatisfied with my
bargain.</p>

<p>When the orchids had been bought, I asked the
cook where he proposed to find pots to put them in,
and he smiled in a very superior fashion, and said
they only wanted some earth and a piece of sacking
to live in, and they could be kept alive by certain
airings and drinks of water; and when I said,
“Who is going to do all this?”</p>

<p>“Domingo, <i lang="es">señora</i>,” he said in a great hurry.
“Domingo is the only one who really understands
plants”—and he grinned and nodded his head with
marvellous rapidity.</p>

<p>I rather fancied the placid Domingo would be
told he knew about plants and have to attend to
them, after the fashion of one or two other “jobs”
I had noticed, but I thought it best not to interfere,
as Domingo is twice the size of the cook, and ought
to be able to look after himself. Later on I saw
the two of them fixing the tall plants, with roots
neatly tied up in sacking bags, to the walls of the
<i lang="es">sala</i>, or rather, Domingo very adroitly tying and
nailing up, while the cook stood by to talk twenty
to the dozen, and came afterwards to me for
approval.</p>

<p>We had a very amusing scene of this description
at the very beginning, when we fixed up the
mosquito nets, on which occasion all hands, myself
included (with needle and cotton) did something
tangible, while the cook devoted the time to
talking and jabbering and hopping about, uncannily
like a monkey.</p>

<p>The orchids are really lovely, and make the
<i lang="es">sala</i> look charming with their masses of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
blooms of mauve and yellow against the white
walls, and in time I must try to get some small
trees in tall Chinese stands of blue and green
earthenware, which adorn the houses here in profusion,
and suit the white paint and brown floors
admirably.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_6">LETTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A WASTED LAND</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>Christmas Eve, 1904</i>.</p>

<p>We have just come back from a delightful drive,
to a town called Molo, which lies inland, in the
direction of the river, but on the opposite bank to
Jaro, the latter, as I think I told you, having been
the capital of the Island of Panay in the olden days.
There is a good road out to both of these towns,
which crosses the river at Molo, and makes a circle,
passing through a village called Mindoriao, and this
is the great drive of the place, in fact the only
one. The whole round is about 8 or 9 miles,
however, which is too long for a <i lang="es">paseo</i> (promenade),
so the carriages roll out at sunset to one of the two
towns, turn round the quaint, ramshackle, old
<i lang="es">plazas</i>, and return whence they came, spinning
along in the fresh night air, with lamps lighted, and
all the little ponies gallantly determined to pass
each other.</p>

<p>Along the sides of the road, for a long way out
of the town, stretches a vast suburb of picturesque
native huts of palm thatch, built on high poles in
the jungle, or standing in the edge of the river,
surrounded by palms and all sorts of tropical trees
of different brilliant greens, through which may
be caught glimpses of intensely blue river or sea
and exquisite mauve mountain ranges.</p>

<p>We enjoyed our drive immensely, and kept
wishing that Papa could see the endless pictures of
brown and yellow huts, women in bright red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dresses, the groups of children and animals, the
grey old Spanish churches and belfries—I think if
you ever came out here he would spend his whole
time on a camp stool, sketching for dear life!</p>

<p>Our cases have come from home at last, though
I don’t know why I should say that, as they have
not been so very long after us, but we were rather
grubbing along till they came, which made the time
seem longer. When C—— was informed they had
arrived, he went down to the Custom House and
spent a long day with the official appraiser, a
most polite and patient young man, weighing and
examining everything. The methods of doing this
are wonderful and alarming, for they weigh the
silver and plate with their leather or wooden cases,
and the duty is charged by so much on the kilo!
Imagine what the proportion is on a dozen silver
spoons or knives in a handsome oak case! All
the italics and exclamations in the biggest printing
house in the world could not convey my sentiments
upon this subject. The textiles are examined
with a magnifying glass, appraised as
materials, and taxed as such, at the rate of 50
per cent., upon what the Customs people choose
to say was their original value. If the material
is made up, there is extra duty of 100 per
cent., which makes me glad that I put so few of
my frocks in the cases. The only way to console
oneself is to think that even with the duty added,
they cost about half what they would if one bought
the materials and had them made up here.</p>

<p>Well, the end of it was that C—— came home
late in the afternoon and told me that the duty
came to 300 <i lang="es">pesos</i>—a little over £30!—and did I
think the things were worth it, or should we send
them back to Hong Kong in bond?</p>

<p>After we had discussed the matter, going into
it all carefully, we came to the conclusion that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
could not find substitutes for our things here for
that sum. So we decided to take them, and the
cases were brought up here by coolies, two or four
carrying each one slung with <i lang="es">bejuco</i> ropes on to a
hard-wood pole.</p>

<p>It is very nice to have all our own things about,
but all the same it is a fearful hardship to have to
pay their value for things that belong to us, and
particularly annoying in the case of the wedding
presents.</p>

<p>This, the arrival of the cases, has been the great
excitement of the week, and from the look of the
box-room, bids fair to continue to excite all hands
for some time to come.</p>

<p>When we get the sketches hung up, the house
will look very pretty, I think, and we are going to
have some of them put in some frames that came
in an old case full of C——’s things from Cebú.
They will look very nice done up with enamel, and
we can get some glass at a Chinaman’s shop, but
all “crystal” comes from outside, of course, and is
subject to a very heavy duty. You may be
surprised, perhaps, to hear me mention Chinese
shops so much, but nearly all the “stores” in the
Philippines are kept by Chinamen, one (as I told
you) by an English company here, and I don’t
know if there are others, but I fancy not, and
the rest by Spaniards and Germans. The chief
businesses, big trading firms, are English all through
the islands, and have been so for fifty years or
more; and there are some Spanish companies,
dealing in tobacco chiefly, and besides these, one or
two Germans and Swiss, who import their native
productions. Nearly all the Americans are official,
military, educational, or missionaries. I am told
that a few of the American soldiers, when the war
was, or was said to be over, settled down on small
plantations in the southern islands, and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
some saloon-keepers in the towns, a boot shop in
Manila, and a struggling mechanic here and there;
but so far, that is the extent of the American business
interest in the place. Planters bringing in capital,
such as our colonies profit by, do not, and never
can, come into this country, for a new American
law exists which prohibits all persons who are not
natives from acquiring more than 40 acres of
Philippine soil, and 40 acres in the tropics is not
worth having, I believe.</p>

<p>I rigged up my bed with my own pillow-cases
and sheets yesterday. They were delicious to sleep
in, and the idea of linen pillow-cases for coolness
and cotton sheets for health is excellent, for a
cotton pillow-covering would be very hot and
uncomfortable, and linen sheets would be dangerous
in such heat. I have got myself an iron bed with
a wire mattress, for I cannot sleep on the Filipino
bed, which is a little platform of woven cane, and
quite hard and unyielding. They are wooden four-posters,
these native beds, with a cotton roof,
usually red, set off by a frill of lace all round the
top, above the mosquito curtains. Some of the
bedsteads I have seen, made of native woods, are
very prettily carved round the pillars, and a really
handsome piece of carving fills the space at each
end to the height of two feet or so. All right so far
as looks go, but the bed itself is an appalling
instrument of torture to lie on, for in pattern and
material it is the same as the seats of cane chairs,
and as hard as iron—all for coolness. On the cane
is spread a native grass mat called a <i lang="es">petate</i>; the
luxurious and faddy add a sheet, but humbler folk
sleep on the mat, which is aired in the sun every
day, or ought to be, and frequently washed. In the
bed there always lies a small, round bolster, called
in Spanish an <i lang="es">embrasador</i>, but the Europeans name
it Dutch Wife, and this is used to fling a leg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
an arm over, for, in this climate, to lie with the limbs
touching would be intolerable discomfort. It is
also a well-known fact that the <i lang="es">embrasador</i> is a
great protection for the stomach against chills and
fevers, which are a danger towards the small hours
of the morning. Bedclothes, in the way of covering,
are out of the question, but in every bed a small,
thin blanket lies folded up, ready for the sudden
chill of a rainy night. Once or twice people have
said to me: “It was so cold last night. I was
shivering even with my blanket.” This is the
winter to them, you see. I only wish it struck me
in the same way, for though the nights are by no
means stifling or anything like that, it would be
delightful to feel cold now and then.</p>

<p>It is so difficult to realise that this is Christmas
Eve—so odd to hear people talking of children’s
parties; and Christmas trees seem absurdly out
of place! The churches began to get excited some
time ago, and for the last week some deadly bells
have begun to clang before the dawn.</p>

<p>The dawn, by-the-bye, is not what I expected,
for I have often read descriptions of the coming of
the tropic day—that is, night one minute and broad
daylight the next. I find, however, that there is
a considerable interval of twilight, both morning
and evening. The other day I read a book by
a very well-known writer, in which a description
was given of the dayspring in Egypt coming like
“the opening of an oven door,” which I knew
to be nonsense as applied to Egypt, and now
I find the same sort of hyperbole about the
tropics equally false; for I have watched the
grey dawn come gradually nearly every morning
here, and I sit reading on the balcony in the twilight,
in the evening. It is certainly not a long
twilight, but all one reads about the sun shooting
up from the night into the tropic day, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
forth, must be what they call “word pictures,”
because it is certainly not truth, or even decent
exaggeration.</p>

<p><i>Christmas Day.</i>—I always write my letters to
you all at one sitting, but I had to break off
yesterday before I considered that I had covered
enough paper to satisfy you, and I feel I can’t
begin again to-day without this fresh heading;
though it is not like Christmas a bit, and I think
the bright green palms, blue sea and sky, and
scorching sun are a very poor substitute for the
lovely brown and purples of the winter landscape
at home, the invigorating cold, and the
exquisite skeletons of oaks and elms.</p>

<p>I should not complain, though, for the weather
here is really delicious just at present, with
frequent heavy showers, which keep the vegetation
fresh, and fill the water-tanks. There are lots
of wells, in which the water is very hard,
and people say it is sea-water filtered through
the soil; and it must be so, for at high tide the
wells are at their fullest, and quite brackish.
So the water-supply one chiefly depends upon
is that out of the rain-water tanks, which are
fed from the corrugated roofs of the houses.
However, it is not safe to drink even that
unfiltered, and some people are very fanciful and
boil it first, but that is rather absurd if one gets
a good filter.</p>

<p>Out of the filter, Sotero, the head boy, fills
up soda-water bottles, which he takes to the
English Club, where they are laid on the ice
for a charge of 2 cents apiece, and these, after an
hour or two on the ice, give us very refreshing
drinks. Good and light beer is to be had, brewed
in Manila; it works out at about a shilling a bottle,
and the Americans drink it, but the English people
consider beer an unwholesome beverage in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
climate, and stick to whisky and soda very faithfully.
Some adopt the Spanish custom of drinking
light red wine, <i lang="es">vino tinto</i>, which is supposed
to be strengthening and blood-making in a
country where the prevailing trouble is anæmia.
This wine comes from Spain in barrels, and I
expect it really is the most wholesome of all.
For my part, I keep pretty generally to lime
juice and soda, or lemon squash. Lemons,
which come from China, are about 2d. apiece.
At this season, in the way of fruit, small tangerines
are to be had also, hailing from China, and
oranges, another luxury, 6d. each. It is rather a
bore that such necessary and wholesome fruit should
cost such ridiculous prices. Bananas, everlasting
bananas, are the chief fruit, and even they are
not astonishingly cheap, as they are sold here at
exactly the same price as in London. Vegetables
there are none, except miserable tomatoes and
egg-plants. The lack of fresh fruit and vegetables
is very trying, especially the vegetables.
Whatever is sold is imported, except the
bananas, tomatoes, and egg-plants. Fresh meat,
too, would be a boon, and butter, and milk, for
all these can only be obtained tinned—“canned”
as they call it here. Once a week we get some
provisions from the Cold Storage in Manila,
Australian meat and butter, and sometimes
vegetables, but this is only a private enterprise
of a few of the English community, who club
together and get down an ice-chest by the
<i>Butuan</i>, the weekly Manila mail. It would
be unwise to venture to lay in more than one
day’s supply, which has to be cooked and eaten
at once before it goes bad, even with an ice-chest
to stand it in.</p>

<p>It might be possible to put up with these
discomforts with more or less philosophic calm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and not mind the deprivations if they were
inevitable, but they are not so by any means,
as the soil of the Philippines is one of the richest
in the world, volcanic and full of natural chemical
manures, the islands having also every sort of advantage
and variety of climate from the plains to the
mountain-tops, and being plentifully watered. I
am for ever being told that anything and everything
will grow and flourish here, which is so aggravating
when all the fresh food to be procured is
miserable poultry, fish, and egg-plants, tomatoes
you would not look at in England, and costly
bananas. Rice and potatoes from China, live
cattle from China, or frozen meat from Australia,
and <em>everything</em> else under the sun in tins from
London or America! This, after six years of
what we are told is the most enlightened system
of Colonial or Tropical Government yet invented.
It is useless to point out that no roads exist inland,
except one in Luzon for the Governor and his
family to go to the hills; or to remark that
labour is too dear for any enterprise to pay, and
that all healthy foreign competition in the way
of labour is excluded—the reply is an invitation
to contemplate the splendid work that is being
done in education. For these schools and swarming
schoolmasters this pastoral country is taxed and
tariffed to breaking point—schools to which the
natives are being taken from the fields, and in which
they are taught a crude wash of bad English and
mathematics. The chief result is to bring all the
“scholars” into the towns to loaf along in clerkships,
if they can get them.</p>

<p>You will laugh at my vehemence! But it does
seem such a pity to see a splendid country wasted, as
it were, thrown away, for the sake of a windy theory
propounded by some well-meaning though ignorant
sentimentalists at the other side of the globe.</p>

<span class="smaller">CUSTOMS AND DRESS OF THE NATIVES</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>December 31, 1904</i>.</p>

<p>I think you may be amused to hear about a
Filipino <i lang="es">Fiesta</i>, which took place yesterday, called
Rizal Day—the anniversary of the death of the
national hero, a Filipino of the name of Doctor
Rizal. He was the William Tell of the Philippines,
except that his existence was a reality, not a
myth, for he died only eight years ago.</p>

<p>This patriot obtained the degree of Doctor (of
Philosophy and Medicine) in Spain, where he
went to be educated and enlightened. When he
returned from that land, Doctor Rizal set to work,
endeavouring to free his countrymen from the
frightful Spanish friars, who were the real rulers
of the Spanish Philippines, and whose cruelty and
wickedness were almost incredible. Any friars
who were not good enough for Spain, were
sent out to the Philippines, where each man
became a little god and tyrant in a tiny <i lang="es">pueblo</i>
(village or district), in which his authority was
unbounded and unquestioned. I suppose some
of these friar-priests must have been good men,
but no one can tell me they ever heard of
such a being, for the enervating climate, lazy life,
complete irresponsibility, and the irresistible power
of the priest over the superstitious, childish Malays
were too much for these men of God; and the
stories of their cruelties, rapacities, and immoralities
are all terrible and often simply sickening. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have heard them from people who lived in the
<i lang="es">pueblos</i>, and the things that went on were like
the Decameron and the Inquisition rolled into
one.</p>

<p>Well, this Doctor Rizal started a revolt against
the power of these dreadful <em>men</em>, if one could call
the friars by such a name, about 1872; and from
that time the rest of his life was a series of plots,
captures, escapes to Europe, imprisonment by the
friars, banishment, return, recapture, till at last,
by the simple device of the friars having Rizal
cabled for to Spain and getting him back to the
Philippines, the avenging Church had him executed,
by order of the Spaniards, on the Luneta,
the Promenade at Manila, on December 30, 1896.
I have met people who were present at the execution
of Rizal, and they tell me that the crowds were
vast, and relate how Rizal faced a line of soldiers
bravely and was shot. Rizal had a nice, clever
face of a refined Filipino type, if one can trust the
portraits on the Conant bank-notes, and the
Filipinos simply adore his memory.</p>

<p>It was in consequence of Rizal’s revolt that
Aguinaldo and the Katipunan arose, who lived to
revenge their hero’s memory, completing his work
by turning the Spaniards and their dreadful priests
out of the Islands. To do this, as you know, they
had to get America to help them; which the
Americans did, and stayed on. The idea is that
they are going to teach the Filipinos how to govern
themselves, which, it appears, ought only to be done
by all peoples and races after the American method.
The Filipinos are said to be delighted about this,
but the puzzling anomaly is that they fought, and
are still fighting the Americans tooth and nail to
get their own liberty, their own way, but they are
not asked what they think at all, and if they show
any signs of wanting to get rid of this American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
burden and govern themselves in their own fashion,
they are called Insurgents and knocked on the
head, or dubbed common robbers and strung up
to a tree.</p>

<p>On account of this state of affairs, the natives
seize on this anniversary to give relief to some of
their patriotic emotions. The day is a public holiday,
they hang out flags and lanterns, and every Filipino
knocks off what little work he ever does, and
crawls about the streets and spits, and every one
of them who is not carrying some musical instrument,
is to be seen taking a cock to or from a
cock-fight; while the women slouch along in gangs
with myriads of children, or else jolt up and down
in hired carriages—and that is the <i lang="es">Fiesta</i>.</p>

<p>They abandon these delirious joys during the
hot hours of the day, from two to four, but swarm
out again in redoubled numbers in the evening,
walking about the streets till midnight in long
processions, carrying paper lanterns of every
shape and colour, and led by a guitar and
mandoline band; while nearly every house is lighted
up, and the big room full of people dancing.</p>

<p>The Filipinos have a natural gift for music of
a very light sort, and I am told by people, who I
do not think are very competent judges, that the
natives perform classic music pretty well too, when
well directed. Everyone plays an instrument of
some sort, the men forming themselves into little
and large societies, bands, in fact, which, on an
occasion like yesterday, go about the streets and
play “Hiawatha” on the slightest provocation. The
trail of Sousa and “rag-time” is over them all, and
their own plaintive, minor melodies, some of them
very beautiful, are never heard now. At least I
say “their own” melodies, but these tunes have a
great flavour of Spain about them, and, of course,
after four centuries of Spanish influence, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
difficult to say what is original Malay and what is
imported.</p>

<p>The dress of the women is a mixture of the
two races—Malay and Spanish—for the tight skirt
(which is not worn in Manila, by-the-bye) is the
<i lang="es">sarong</i> of the Straits; and the muslin blouse or
jacket, with its huge starched sleeves and <i lang="es">panuelo</i>
(a sort of folded <i lang="es">fichu</i> collar which sticks up behind)
is an interesting survival of the fashions in vogue
in Europe, in the days when Spain took these
Islands on one side of the globe, and fought the
mariners of Elizabeth on the other. Beyond these
two garments the outfit is simplicity itself, for it
consists of one long cotton chemise. I don’t think
you’ve ever seen a <i lang="es">sarong</i>, by-the-bye, which, when
it is off, is like a bottomless sack; and when it is
on, is drawn tightly across the back and tucked
in over itself at the top, when it makes an outline
exactly like the petticoats in Egyptian monuments,
quite close at the back, with a fold like a
kilt in front. Then over the upper part comes
the muslin bodice, which is made in one piece, with
a hole to slip over the head, after the fashion of a
jibbah. It looks very cool, but the cut is clumsy,
and the fashion is dwarfing to the tiny Filipino
figures; while the big sticking-up collar gives a
round-shouldered effect, and spoils what is one of
their best points, a graceful set and carriage of
the head and neck. They walk very straight, with
all the motion from the hips, and their feet very
much turned out, and generally wear no jewellery
of any sort, except perhaps a pair of gold earrings,
or a ring or two, or a rosary of European patterns.
There is nothing characteristic in the way of native
work or beads. The well-to-do Filipino women
wear more trinkets, and the <i lang="es">Mestizas</i> (Eurasians)
cover themselves with cheap and tawdry ornaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The favourite material for the <i lang="es">camisa</i> (bodice)
is a native muslin woven from the fibres of pine-apple
leaves, called <i lang="es">piña</i>, an exclusive manufacture
of the Islands of Panay and Negros, where the
pine-apples grow wild in the jungles. This the
Filipino women weave with or without silk stripes
and checks, and dye all sorts of colours; but the
lower classes and peasants hardly ever wear anything
beyond the plain, undyed yellowish-white, which,
after all, suits them far better than any other colour.
They look well though, on great occasions, in
crimson, purple, or yellow, and they are wise when
they stick to those warm colours, for blues and
greens are fatally unbecoming to their yellow-brown
skins, making them look heavy and dirty. They
seem to have no natural taste for colour though, as
they use some appalling aniline dyes, and make
mixtures which set one’s teeth on edge. They are
only really safe when they stick to the red <i lang="es">sarong</i>
and undyed <i lang="es">camisa</i>.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">piña</i> is woven on hand-looms, which can
be seen and heard clicking in almost every hut, and
it is sent all over the Islands, and fetches enormous
prices, but then it is practically everlasting, and
when washed and done up with rice-starch, it looks
like new.</p>

<p>They also have a muslin, much cheaper stuff,
called <i lang="es">Jusi</i> (pronounced Hoosee), which is made
from a fibre procured in China; and a third, and
still cheaper one woven from hemp fibres and called
<i lang="es">sinamay</i>—and the result of it all is that to the
uninitiated the three materials all look exactly
alike! On the <i lang="es">piña</i> the women do a very beautiful
embroidery of graceful designs worked out in fine
white sewing-cotton and marvellously shaded, mixed
with drawn threads, and some of the antique pieces
are exquisite. This <i lang="es">piña</i> embroidery is the only
characteristic Filipino work I have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
see or hear of, except the decoration of some
weapons, and the grass mats with patterns.</p>

<p>The dress of the men I think I have already
hinted at, and it, too, is the last word in simplicity
(short of the loin-cloth, which costume is not
allowed in the towns), for all the Filipinos wear in
the house is tight drawers and a vest, and when
they go out they draw on over those a pair of
white or blue cotton trousers and a collarless shirt,
rather like a Chinaman’s coat, which I described to
you before, I think. This shirt hangs outside the
trousers, really looking much better than it sounds,
and on galas and occasions of state they turn out
in an ordinary European shirt, with a starched
front, all pleated and embroidered, such as Frenchmen
and Germans sometimes wear, and they look
so clean and smart in them. In fact they look
quite nice in their native costume, but unfortunately
many of them now affect the white man’s buttoned-up
linen coat, with stand-up starched collar, and
put on shoes and stockings, which subtly vulgarises
the wearers at once. Like all coloured races and
many white ones, as soon as they attempt modern
European fashions the Filipino taste is villainous,
and they look inexpressibly common and disheartening.</p>

<p>They are so clean—so scrupulously clean—all
their clothes, even those of the very poorest, being
spotless and fresh. They are for ever washing
their bodies, too, or at least it is certain that the
poor people are, for they may be seen at the wells
and outside their houses tubbing ingenuously, the
men with a single fold of stuff retained for decency,
the women struggling inside a wet <i lang="es">sarong</i>.</p>

<p>We went yesterday evening for a walk along
the beach, on the side of this spit where the view
embraces the open sea and the end of the Island of
Guimaras, the latter with a promontory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
mountainous Negros jutting out behind and beyond
it, and all the rest clear horizon. The tide was
out, so we walked on the firm wet sand at the edge
of the waves, little, flat waves which did not run
up very far, as the beach is steep and shelving.
Over the mountains, inland, the sky was a deep
glowing orange and crimson, but from where we
were on the beach we could not see the mountains,
only glimpses of the gorgeous colour through the
high palms that fringe the shore; while on the
other side, out to sea, was a reflection like a
delicate wash of pinky gold, set above deep blue
sea and purple islands.</p>

<p>We walked a good long way, as far as the
ends of the streets that come down on the beach,
all dark with points of light, for the air was
deliciously soft and the breeze almost fresh, and
as the sunset faded, the stars came out and
made quite a light upon the water, they looked
so big and bright. We enjoyed the walk very
much, and though we are too far this side
of the town to be able to walk as far as the open
country, we are very lucky not to be a long way
from the beach, where we can always get a breath
of fresh air and admire the lovely evenings.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_8">LETTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOCIAL AMUSEMENTS</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>January 8, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>This is my first letter to you in the New Year, and
it does seem so strange to be writing 1905 already.</p>

<p>I wonder how you brought the year in. We
were invited to a ball given by the Club Artistica,
the Spanish Club, situated in a suite of very large
rooms in the upper story of a big house in the Calle
Real, the main street of the town, which I told you
about when I was describing the amazing shops.
The big basements are shops, but the long upper
stories form large dwelling houses, very swagger
ones, only the dust and noise are very disagreeable,
and the rents about the same as flats in the best
part of London, if not more. On these two
accounts, most of them stand empty, displaying
long rows of closed shutters, all the outside painted
the prevailing bluey-grey. Some are used as clubs,
however, one being this Artistica, and another,
further down the street, the Filipino Club, which is
called the Santa Cecilia—dedicated very appropriately
to the patron saint of music, you see. These
two clubs are very hospitable, and do nearly all the
entertaining in the place, except for an occasional
lecture at the Y.M.C.A., which, I daresay, is a wild
revel, only I’ve never summoned up courage to go
and see. The Swiss and Germans have a club, I
believe, and the English Club has a beautiful house
of its own, but neither of these institutions does
anything towards the gaiety of nations, beyond playing
billiards among their own members exclusively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
It is a relief, however, to think that the poor
fellows do not have such a very bad time as one
might imagine, for they accept everything and go
everywhere. The same comforting remark applies
to the Americans, who have no club and don’t
entertain privately, except tea or Bridge parties
amongst each other. So, as I said before, it falls
to the Spaniards and Filipinos to keep the place
alive, and very well they do it too, if the ball on
New Year’s Eve was a specimen of their average
entertainments.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, Eurasians, and natives are
all passionately fond of dancing, and <em>really</em> fond
of it, for they do not make it a question of
supper, as people do at home. All you have to
do here is to clear the floor and get in some
musicians (half the difficulty here is to keep groups
of musicians out), and apparently your friends flow
in. When we are coming home in the evenings,
we often see the <i lang="es">salas</i> of quite little houses lighted
up and full of people dancing, and I have seen
small native huts having a <i lang="es">baile</i> of two couples
jostling round in a space 10 feet square.</p>

<p>The chief room of the Spanish Club is a large
apartment, almost a hall, where, on ordinary
evenings, the members can be seen through the
big lighted window-spaces, sitting about at little
tables, with glasses at their elbows, playing
dominoes; but for the <i lang="es">baile</i> the club was cleared
and hung with electric lights in paper flowers, and
decorated with flags and palm branches, while in a
large recess at one side was a numerous string band
of Filipino performers.</p>

<p>The music was excellent, but so slow that, as
far as I was concerned, dancing was no pleasure,
though that was not much of a grievance to me, as
I was really far more anxious to look on than
to dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>We were invited for ten o’clock, but when we
arrived at eleven the entertainment was only just
getting into full swing. We had missed the opening
<i lang="es">Rigodon</i>, a dance without which no Filipino <i lang="es">baile</i>
could get under weigh at all, but the second half of
the programme began with one, and I was very
much interested to see it.</p>

<p>Everyone who wanted to dance the <i lang="es">Rigodon</i>,
and there were only about three people who did
not, sat round the room in an immense square, as
for a cotillon, and the band struck up a very jolly
old Spanish tune, to which the sides facing each
other went through a few simple figures at a very
slow walk. When they had done, they sat down,
and the other two sides took their turn; and that,
to different tunes, was the whole dance, which went
on for an incredible length of time. The figures
were a mixture of lancers and quadrilles, but the
dancers never went out of a dignified strut, and
though the first tune was followed by the inevitable
Sousa marches and “Hiawatha,” however lively the
music became, the dancers continued to stroll and
bow and shuffle about at the same slow pace. I
am told that one becomes very fond of the <i lang="es">Rigodon</i>,
but it seemed to me intolerably dull and listless as
a dance, though as a spectacle it was vastly entertaining,
and gave one a chance of really seeing the
people, and they were well worth the trouble of
turning out after dinner to look at.</p>

<p>The men wore white suits, most of them
buttoned-up white coats of the every day sort.
There were three Englishmen in evening dress, one
or two in white mess jackets, and several advanced
young Filipinos in grey tweeds. The American
women wore every sort of outfit, from the missionaries
and schoolma’ams in blouses and boots to the
more exalted personages in evening dress; while
the Filipinas, <i lang="es">Mestizas</i>, and most of the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
had on the native muslin <i lang="es">camisa</i>, some of them
exquisitely embroidered and hand-painted, and
always worn with European skirts of appalling
colours and cut. One little brown woman had on
a long train of scarlet plush, with huge white lace
butterflies fixed across and down the front, which
made one burst into perspiration merely to look
at; and another was in emerald green velvet, with
straggling bands of gold braid meandering over it
in such a queer way that I could not resist walking
round her to see if any point of view would make
the lines come out as a pattern, but they refused to
go by any rule of any art—even the “newest.”</p>

<p>As to the waltzes, which formed the chief part
of the programme, they were very amusing too, for
the variety of styles was infinite, though the
universal pace was so slow. The Spaniards and
<i lang="es">Mestizos</i> dance very well, and by that, of course, I
mean Filipinos in general, for it is very difficult to
distinguish between them, and to say where one
race begins and the other leaves off. They are
slow and graceful. The Americans are equally
slow, but not very graceful, for they <em>walk</em> instead
of dance, holding each other in such a peculiar
way, sideways and very close, the man leaning very
far back, with his partner falling towards him, and
the hands that are clasped held very high, and
swinging up and down.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock everyone began to cheer and
shake hands as the New Year came in; while the
band played the American National Anthem, which
is a most magnificent air, and then the Spanish
Anthem, and then a few bars of “God Save the
King,” which did for us and the Germans equally
well, and which we all thought a very nice little
compliment. Filipino waiters came in, carrying
trays covered with tall glasses full of some sort of
champagne cup, and everyone drank healths, shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hands, and wished their friends a Happy New Year.
We stayed on a little longer, and I danced a
two-step with a very nice American, which was the
best dance I had the whole evening, for it is one
in which they excel, though they perform it
quite differently to what we are told at home is
“the real American way to dance it,” as they do
not plunge down the room in straight lines in the
English fashion, but turn round more and make
more of a waltz of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, during an interval between dances
in the middle of the programme, without a word
of warning, a <i lang="es">Mestiza</i> sat down at the piano
and played an accompaniment to which a young
Eurasian, in a painfully blue satin dress, and
with her face a ghastly grey-white with thick
powder, sang a truly terrible song. She screamed
in an awful manner, and I wondered that policemen
did not rush up from the streets to see
what was the matter, but she was perfectly self-possessed,
and faced the audience with the aplomb
and self-confidence of a prima-donna. I never
heard such “singing” in my life—it was the
sort of thing that is so bad that you feel all hot
and ashamed, and sorry, and don’t want to catch
the eye of any relation of the performer. This
happened not once, but several times, and is,
I am told, a custom in Filipino <i lang="es">bailes</i>.</p>

<p>When we left at about half-past one, the
ball was in full swing, and I afterwards heard
that it went on till half-past four or five.
Indefatigable people! I don’t know how they
can keep it up so, for, of course, the heat was
very great—a temperature in which no one
would dream of dancing at home, and not a
breath of cool air anywhere, but I suppose
they become accustomed to it.</p>

<p>One thing I have mentioned may strike you as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
odd, and that is the mixture of races and Eurasians,
but there is socially no marked colour-distinction
here as in every other country in the world, and
this, I imagine, is because the natives of the
civilised parts of the Philippines have been
Christians for centuries, and intermarried with
a Christian race. The fusion is not, however,
really very complete, as one can see from a glance,
at any gatherings, where the people of various
shades of white and brown keep very much
together. Some of the Eurasian women are
quite pretty, but they spoil their little round
faces with thick layers of powder over their
nice brown skins, and use perfumes that nearly
knock one down. The white men are friendly
with many of the <i lang="es">Mestizos</i>, and dance with
their pretty daughters, and are even occasionally
foolish enough to marry the latter; but white
women keep quite apart from the coloured folk,
and it would be an unheard-of thing to dance with
one; while as to marrying a Filipino, no woman one
could speak to would ever dream of such a
horrible fate. That is where the real impassable
gulf is fixed. The Americans profess not to
recognise any distinction, however, for, as I
explained before, they announce that they consider
the Filipino of any class as their social
and every other equal, and have the expression
“little brown brother” (invented by Mr. Taft),
which is supposed to convey and establish this
generous sentiment. The sentiment, apart from
any political utility it may possess, is a noble
one, but it does more credit to the heart of the
Americans than to their wisdom.</p>

<p>The Spaniards did not recognise the Filipinos
as equals, but treated them with every courtesy,
according to their degree, and I believe that
whatever the political situation may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in those days, society went peaceably enough,
for every man knew his place and kept it; a system
admirably suited to an Oriental people. Now,
however, the <i lang="fr">régime</i> is quite different, and the
sudden glare of ultra-equalising views is what the
Filipinos can neither understand nor profit by.</p>

<p>I wish I had been in the U.S.A to see
many things for myself, but I have always read
and heard much about the hard and fast line drawn
in that country against “coloured” people and
half-castes, and that the Americans have learned
to adopt this custom from years of experience.
This makes their professed attitude here very
puzzling, and I can find no one who can even
attempt to reconcile this extraordinary variation
of opinion. Another unfathomable anomaly of
American thought is that the “Equality,” Nobility
of the Human Race—Rights as a human Being,
and so on, are for the <em>Filipinos</em>, but all these
grand schemes officially take no account of the
fierce, naked savages; the Mahommedan tribes;
the negritoes, and all the other wild natives of
the Philippines; though how, or where, or when,
or by whom the line is to be drawn and the
distinction made is another unanswerable problem.</p>

<p>New Year’s Day being a holiday, we thought
we would treat ourselves to a drive. So we sent
one of the boys out for a <i lang="es">carromata</i>, which is a
sort of tiny gig, with the driver sitting on a
small seat in front of his fare, in fact almost on
one’s lap. Rain had been falling pretty well
all day, and the <i lang="es">carromata</i>, when it arrived,
was covered with mud, and looked such a disreputable
turn-out that we burst out laughing when
we saw it. However, there was no other to be
had, and after all it was a very good specimen,
so we climbed in over the wheel, and the driver,
a boy of about twelve, gave the pony a chuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and a whack, and it turned round in the direction
of the Plaza, and we stuck. Then the driver
got down, and when he was out of the way
and the pony became visible, we saw that we
weighed the cart down so much at the back
that as the little animal turned round he got
his neck wedged under the shaft and was
held in a rigid yoke. The youthful <i lang="es">cochero</i>
shoved him down somehow, evidently both of
them quite accustomed to the trouble, and, once
righted, the little beast tore along, and we had a
delightful drive in the cool of the evening, enjoying
the air, which was so fresh after the rain.</p>

<p>We did not go far out of the town, as the sky
was rather threatening, but kept more or less
to the ever-amusing suburbs of native huts, which
literally swarm with human beings, to every one of
whom there is apparently an allowance of about
six babies of under one year old, and on the roofs
are cocks and hens clinging to the steep thatch;
while under the hut lives the family <i lang="es">carabao</i> (a big
grey water-buffalo) in his mudhole, along with stray
dogs and wild pigs which eat up the refuse.</p>

<p>The number of children, very young children,
is something astounding, but, according to statistics,
I learn that 60 per cent. of the children born in
the Philippines die under one year old, so that
must help to keep the numbers of grown-up
people down a bit. They are miserable little
languid scraps, thin and solemn, but so supremely
fortunate as to wear no clothes whatever, till they
are about six, when a short muslin jacket is put
on, which is more for adornment than anything
else. The tiny ones ride astride the mother’s
hip, with little thin legs dangling, and round black
head wobbling about, looking so uncomfortable,
poor little souls. They are fed on rice, which they
eat till their little bodies swell up to a certain tightness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
when the food is taken away, and they are not
allowed more till they have “gone down” again.
This process results in a permanent “rice-tummy,”
which makes the babies look like air-balloons set
on drumsticks; but, somehow, they lose that
as they get older, and if they live, are generally
very slender and well made.</p>

<p>There is a great fuss made now about this
waste of infant life, much of which is ascribed to
the horrible and unhuman practices and superstitions
attending the birth of a Filipino child;
but I imagine from the appearance of the children
themselves, that the whole question is merely an
example of the Survival of the Fittest, for of so
many children born in such a delicate race there
must be numbers who are unable and unfit to live.
They are not a hardy people, these Filipinos, and the
heat, fevers, and plagues of the country affect them
even more than they do the white races, oddly
enough. I believe that in the wild parts the
natives are stronger, and sometimes live to a great
age; but there the life is simpler; the cross-breeding
less frequent; in the absence of civilisation of
any kind the great Darwinian Law operates even
more rigorously; and the young who are sickly
stand no chance at all of growing up and transmitting
their weakness. The skin of these people is
not a healthy skin, not a warm brown, but of a
greeny-yellowy brown; their fingers are delicate
and weak, and their eyes not clear or bright, but
like little bits of dull plum-brown jelly.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_9">LETTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">TARIFFS—INSECTS</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>January 16, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>The day has come round for me to catch the
mail, but I feel that I can hardly write calmly, as
I am barely sane upon the subject I wish to tell
you about, which is the Customs. I told you
about the opening of our cases, and how we took
them out of bond, as they were valued at £30?
Well, a day or two ago the bill came in, and when
we saw it we nearly fainted away, for the amount
of duty came to 698 <i lang="es">pesos</i>—£70.</p>

<p>Of course we thought some mistake had been
made, so C—— went off to the Customs officer
and asked him what it meant. All the consolation
we got was that they were very sorry for us,
but the Appraiser had made a mistake, and classed
some of our things under Class B instead of
Class A.</p>

<p>So C—— said he could not afford this sum,
which was far more than the whole of the contents
of the cases were worth if they had been
new. Of course it was impossible to send them
back to Hong Kong, as we had taken them out of
bond; but after a lot of talk, the officer said we
could “abandon the goods” if we liked, which
means refuse to pay the duty, when the things
would be seized by the Customs and sold by
auction to pay the Government; but we should be
unable, by law, to buy them in ourselves. This
seemed to be the only alternative open to us, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
C—— came back and asked me what I thought
of it, and asked the other Englishmen their opinion.
They were full of sympathy and very kind, and
at last one of them hit upon an excellent idea,
which was to attend the sale and buy our things
in for us as cheaply as possible. This, then, was
arranged, but—“Oh no!” said the Customs, “you
won’t gain anything by that, because if goods, when
put up for sale, do not fetch the price at which
the Customs House has valued them, they are
publicly burned.”</p>

<p>So that is the end of our story. We have paid
more than their value for our wedding-presents,
which seems to me the meanest and cruellest imposition
I ever heard of. But I won’t say any more,
for the subject can only be as painful to you as it is
to us. We must just grin and bear it, I suppose,
but good-bye to a pony and trap for a longer time
than ever, and good-bye to any little jaunts in the
hot season.</p>

<p>I must try instead to be more pleasant, and the
only thing I can think of is a little lizard I have
been looking at for the last ten minutes, while my
thoughts roamed gloomily over each one of those
seventy good golden sovereigns that have gone to
help to teach the Filipino that he is my equal. A
worthy cause, no doubt, but one that does not
appeal to me—at any rate to the extent of 698
<i lang="es">pesos</i>.</p>

<p>This little lizard, which lives in the cornice above
my writing-desk, has just come down on to the
window beside me and nipped up a fly in the
smartest manner. This is his hunting-ground, for
the windows in the house only have sliding
shutters, such as I described to you, like all the
houses here. Glass windows are almost unknown,
but this house happens to have them along the
S.-W. front, where some former occupant has put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
doors on to the balcony, with glass in the upper
panels, because in the rainy season the Monsoon
drives in on this side.</p>

<p>In all the houses here these little grey lizards
abound, living in the cornices and corners of the
ceilings, and feeding on flies, mosquitoes, and any
little toothsome creature they can pick up. They
must have plenty of supplies and wide variety, for
one seems to come across some new sort of insect
every hour of the day—and night. No fleas,
however, I don’t mean that, for Filipinos are clean
and fleas are rare; but all sorts of queer insects
crawl and fly and sit about, all of which I suppose
the lizards enjoy; and I imagine they, in their turn,
are having a good meal off some other still tinier
creature.</p>

<p>The ceilings are made of bulges of canvas or
matting painted white, pale blue, or green; or, in
some of the old houses, with patterns, as in Italy.
In one house in Jaro, a big building with long, wide-open
window-spaces, there is a ceiling that is covered
with some sort of shiny oilcloth stuff, drawn up by
buttons at intervals, so that it looks like the seat of
some giant padded leather chair—a most fearful
looking contrivance, but, no doubt, a source of much
pride to the Filipino who owns it. There is a wide
space above these ceilings, for the corrugated iron
roofs are very deep, and here live rats, mice, cats,
cockroaches, snakes, all sorts of beasts, which come
down into the house for plunder. The nicest are
these dear, clean, bright-eyed little lizards, which
make a funny and very pretty note, a sort of clear,
musical chuck-chuck. Sometimes, but very rarely,
one of these lizards is found with a forked tail, and
this the natives look upon as an emblem of the
most extraordinary luck, and they do all they can
to catch the lizard and try to take off his forked tail,
which they dry and wear for <i lang="es">anting-anting</i>. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
kind of luck, or lucky emblem, is <i lang="es">anting-anting</i>,
and the mystical emblems, observances, and relics
of Roman Catholicism, which appeal to the
Filipinos with irresistible force, have but added to
their original stock of superstitions.</p>

<p>In some of the houses there is a very <i lang="es">anting-anting</i>
lizard, of a large size, which makes a loud,
clear double note like a cuckoo, that can be heard
a long way off. I have never seen a “Philippine
cuckoo,” as they are called, but have often heard
them, and the houses that have this <i lang="es">anting-anting</i>
are well known. There is one in the old
belfry at Jaro, another in a house the other side of
the Plaza there, and one in a certain bamboo clump
on the road to Molo, and so on, all over the place.</p>

<p>A very general belief prevails that in the roof of
each house there lives a big snake, which has a
terrific meal of rats every now and then, and sleeps
the rest of his time, coming down very rarely for
water. I can quite credit this story, for the space
between the roofs must be the very place for a
snake, and many people tell me they have seen
these creatures, but I don’t suppose they are really
in all the houses. Curiously enough, I thought
there was a snake overhead before I had ever been
told about such a thing, for one day, when I was
sitting in the <i lang="es">sala</i>, I heard a most extraordinary
noise in the roof overhead—a sort of heavy,
dragging sound, and then a thump, and then the
dragging sound again—and, somehow, the thought
of a snake instantly came into my mind. When I
spoke about it to some friends, half jokingly, they
replied quite seriously that it probably was a snake
I had heard, and then told me how they live in the
roofs.</p>

<p>Talking of noises, one of the most curious sounds
here is made by the crickets, the <i lang="es">cicadas</i>, which shrill
night and day, ceaselessly and for ever. The ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
becomes accustomed to the aggregate sound of their
high, thin note, though I, for one, never get to like
it, and sometimes it gets horribly on my nerves, so
that I feel I must go anywhere to get away from it.
At first when I heard it I was always having a
curious impression of being in a Swiss field in the
summer; but now that has worn off, and I think if
I ever go into the Swiss fields again I shall think of
nothing but Iloilo. When one of these <i lang="es">cicadas</i>
gets very near the house, it drives you nearly
mad, and when, as happened a few evenings ago,
one is actually in the house, everything must be
searched for the beast before anyone can expect
sanity or sleep. This one that got in, stowed itself
away in the writing-table, and we had an awful
time, standing almost on our heads and streaming
from every pore, before we found it in a tiny corner
where one of the drawers does not run quite into
place. When we fished the <i lang="es">cicada</i> out at last, or
rather when one of the servants came in and took
up the hunt for us and caught it, we found the
disturber of our peace to be an ugly little browny-black
creature, with a narrow waist, and the silly
thing refused to give a single chirrup to show us
how it was done.</p>

<p>Talking of insects, one of the things we are most
fortunate about in this house is that we have very
few of the black or red ants, which are a fearful
plague in these Islands, so much so that one has to
stand the furniture with its feet in small enamel
bowls filled with water or paraffine to prevent the
ants crawling up, for they eat everything; and
besides that, they look particularly nasty when dead
in jam or butter, or floating in tea or coffee.
Some of these ants are a good size, but the common
sort are very small, and many of the most destructive
are simply red specks that run like lightning.
They are terrible destroyers, and I can’t think why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ant-eaters don’t start living in the roof menageries,
for they would get on splendidly if they did not die
of over-eating. However, the ants do scavenge to
a certain extent, and the way a busy little mob can
carry off a huge dead cockroach is a lesson in
natural history.</p>

<p>The cockroaches, by-the-bye, are the size of
mice. They are the most evil brutes I ever saw,
besides being a constant source of terror and worry.
You will hardly believe this, for you know that I
never mind touching any animal—mice, worms,
toads, slugs, earwigs—and how I have so often been
laughed at, and even sniffed at, as rather an
unpleasant young person, because I have no repugnance
to taking them up in my bare hand, for,
after all, they are only poor animals, and infinitely
nicer to touch than many perfectly respectable
human beings. Do you remember those people
at Karnak who screamed when I brought them
that lovely little toad with a speckled stomach?
And the good folk at home who shudder if you
pick up a poor slug out of a dusty road? Well,
when it comes to these cockroaches, I confess
that I have a genuine horror of the great red, evil-smelling
brutes, with their horrible bulgy eyes and
their long moving red antennæ. I can’t tell you
what it is about them—but I am not alone in this,
for everyone has a horror of them. They breed in
the cesspits, and prefer manure to any other diet,
but will gladly supplement their <i lang="fr">menu</i> with any
form of food, as well as leather, paper, books, or
clothes. The houses, the shops, and the steamers are
full of them, and in the evenings they come out of
their holes and run about. Ugh! they make one
shudder. And every now and then they take it
into their heads to fly about or into the lighted
rooms, and I have even seen men who have been
here for years turn quite sick when a cockroach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
lights on them, and as for the average woman,
she screams outright, and many white women
faint.</p>

<p>These horrible brutes are the curse of housekeeping,
necessitating everything being kept in
glass jars or tins, and cupboards and drawers being
overhauled and searched every week or so. I must
say, though, that we have not had so much
trouble with them as most people, and so far I
have never had one amongst the linen or clothes,
and I believe this is because I hang cakes of
naphthaline in the rooms, and put balls of it in all
boxes, drawers, and cupboards, and they don’t
seem to like naphthaline, though they would come
a thousand miles to eat ordinary insect powder,
which is, apparently, just the very thing on which
to bring up a nice little family of forty or fifty
young cockroaches.</p>

<p>There are some pleasing spiders too, one of
which I saw the other day, with a body nearly the
size of the palm of my hand, sitting in a huge,
tough web like a hammock, and looking exactly
like those in Doré’s picture of the Guest Chamber
in the Castle Inn, in Croque Mitaine.</p>

<p>I said there were very few fleas, but the mosquitoes
make up for any biting that has to be done.
I am beginning to get more accustomed to their
venom now, but at first I was quite ill and feverish
from it, and many people suffer so that it amounts
to an illness, and white men frequently have to
be invalided home for nothing but mosquitoes.
Nothing I have ever seen in any place round the
Mediterranean approaches the Philippine mosquito
for venom or ferocity, and here, too, their efforts
are not confined to the night-season when lucky
mortals are stowed under nets with no rents
in them, but they bite relentlessly all day as
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, I tried to leave harrowing subjects and
tell you something more cheerful than the Customs
woes, but I seem to have drifted into other griefs,
and as my spirits are evidently damped beyond
hope to-day, I had better leave off writing and end
my letter.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_10">LETTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">A FILIPINO THEATRE—<i lang="es">CARABAOS</i></span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>January 22, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We went a night or two ago to a performance at
the theatre—a Filipino performance in a Filipino
theatre. I daresay it sounds strange to you to
hear of a theatre in Iloilo, but you see this is
really a very large town, and then all the people
are musical, and they have plenty of time to rehearse.
They get together little dramatic clubs, the chief
one of which is not far from here, “as the crow
flies,” though I think he would be a very keen
crow for theatricals if he flew there as straight
as he could. We heard this performance, an
operetta, being rehearsed night and day before the
performers considered it ready for the theatre.
The rehearsals that went on until the early hours
of the morning were those we cared least about;
but we were really interested to hear them going
on all day as well, for no one in the Dramatic
Club apparently had any other occupation in
life. At least, this seemed to me strange till I
had become better acquainted with the Filipino
character.</p>

<p>To get to this show, we set off after dinner,
driving in a hired <i lang="es">quielez</i> with a disturbing cockroach
somewhere about it, and soon came to a
squash of all sorts of carriages and carts in one of
the broader streets of the town—and a squash of
vehicles driven by Filipinos is something no human
mind can imagine without experience. We escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
alive, and went in at a big gateway into a courtyard,
passing several stalls lighted with flaring
naphtha, where native women sat behind flat rush
trays containing cakes and sweetmeats, tumblers of
coloured drinks, and ordinary ginger-beer and
lemonade bottles. This, though I did not know it
at the time, was the buffet.</p>

<p>Inside the courtyard another high gate, decorated
at the sides with palms and paper roses, and
very dimly lighted, led to the door of the theatre,
a big, crazy-looking building, and here stood two
inconceivably stupid and self-satisfied natives
bullying everyone, and making a hopeless and
baffling muddle of the tickets. Why they did this
I can’t think, as everyone passed into the place
alike, whatever their ticket was, and scrambled up
a broad wooden staircase, very steep and rickety,
or else went about the ground-floor, every man
looking for his own seat, and getting turned out of
it by the next comer.</p>

<p>The “boxes” were little pens railed off, containing
six chairs with no room for your knees, and
in and out of these and up and down the precipitous
staircase jostled a crowd of Filipinos, <i lang="es">Mestizos</i>,
Chinamen, and Spaniards, with little dark women
in gaudy <i lang="es">camisas</i>, wearing flowers in their hair and
diamond brooches. Here and there an American
was patiently and persistently trying to gather
information in his own language, while he took
some female relation in a white cotton dress
upstairs and then down again, to keep her quiet.</p>

<p>I was so amused by these proceedings that I
really felt as if it did not matter whether that was
all we saw, but, nevertheless, we toiled up the
staircase at the promptings of an obliging Filipino
with one eye, very soon found our box, and settled
down to wait for the friends who were to join us.</p>

<p>In about two minutes, however, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
engaged in an endless discussion with a little mob
of “brown brothers,” who declared quite politely
that we had no right there, as the box was theirs.
So we moved off and tried the ground-floor again;
found another box with our number on it, empty;
sat down again, put fans and programmes on the
opposite chairs, and began to look about.</p>

<p>But we were shifted again, so this time we
tackled a native selling programmes, and asked him
where our box was, and why the little pens all
seemed to have the same number; and he, in very
broken Spanish, at last made us understand that
the numbers were repeated six times, once on each
side upstairs and down. This was a wonderful
effort of lucidity for a Filipino, and really helped
us a good deal. So we toiled upstairs again,
feeling sure that we knew all about the theatre
now, and determined on a shot at the sides. On
the way there we were delighted to see that the
people who had turned us out of our first box were
being ousted in their turn, but by this time we had
begun to giggle, and were too helpless with heat
and laughter to take much notice of anything. At
last we got into a box from which we were never
evicted during the rest of the evening, though some
people did come along with a programme-seller to
back their claim, but we showed fight, and they
went away again.</p>

<p>The theatre, a long, wooden building, appeared
even more ramshackle from the inside than it had
from the outside, and infinitely more dangerous, for
the electric light was supplemented by Japanese
paper lanterns, which looked the last word in
incendiarism; and, when one considered the packed
mass of faces all round, it was wiser not to let the
imagination dwell on that steep wooden stairway,
which was all there was between us and the next
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The floor of the building was arranged with
rows of chairs facing squarely, by way of stalls,
surrounded by a row of the boxes I have described,
where the chairs went sideways. Above jutted out
a broad balcony with a similar row of boxes, and
above that again, jammed under the ceiling, was a
dense crowd of poor people, standing on what was
really only a ledge with an iron rail; and they
looked positively more like huge black and white
flies clinging to the ceiling than anything else.</p>

<p>Everything looked as if it must fall down or
break up, but no one seemed to be worrying about
their doom, in fact all the faces were remarkably
pleasant and jolly.</p>

<p>The stage was a fairly large one, with a row of
electric footlights, which waxed and waned and
waxed again at their own sweet will, and quite
regardless of the needs of the performance. In
front of the stage, on the floor-level, was an
orchestra of natives who really played very well
indeed, and they and all the men in the audience
were in white, which looks very quaint until one’s
eye is accustomed to it.</p>

<p>The piece performed was an operetta called
“La Indiana,” a rather confused story about some
old <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> with a white beard, whose son had
secretly married an Indian, which is the word the
Spaniards use for the Filipinos, and is employed by
the Filipinos themselves as well, when talking
Spanish. Well, the old father informed his son, an
appalling, gawky, young <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> in a black morning
coat, pepper and salt tweed trousers, and a very
bright blue tie, that he must marry a white (<i lang="es">Mestiza</i>)
girl of his, the father’s choosing. On hearing which,
the hero sang a song to the effect that he would
abandon the <i lang="es">Indiana</i>, and had a long duet with
that personage to explain that they would just say
nothing at all about being married. Then all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
chorus came in again, the old father blessed the hero
and the “white” girl, whereupon the <i lang="es">Indiana</i>, a
frightfully ugly Filipina with a fine voice, sang
a long and frenzied solo with her hair down—and
then the curtain fell.</p>

<p>I thought there must be another act, and was
very much surprised to find that was the conclusion
of the story. But evidently, to the native imagination,
the plot was complete and the ends of poetic
justice satisfied. They did not really act and sing
as badly as I had expected, though, when one came
to think of “La Indiana” as a public performance
in a theatre, it really verged on audacity. No
attempt at scenery or dress was made, the whole
action taking place in a bare, worn, old “set” of a
room, the usual stage room, unlike anything else on
earth, and the only attempt at costume was the
substitution of very ugly old European blouses for
the <i lang="es">camisa</i>, which was a fatal mistake.</p>

<p>We left after the first piece, though there were
to be two more of the same sort, for it was very
dull and depressing. There is nothing in these
Filipinos, you see, for they have not the melodious
voices of negroes, nor the faultless ear of Spaniards,
nor the fine physique of Chinese, nor the taste of
Japanese—they are simply dull, blunt, limited
intelligences, with the ineffable conceit of such a
character all over the world, and when they break
out into a display such as “La Indiana,” all these
deplorable qualities show up in the glare of the
white light that beats even upon an Iloilo stage.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went for a delightful drive out
along the Jaro road, off which we turned a little
way beyond the town, and went down a rough,
sandy track to the banks of a broad, half-dried-up
river, not the Iloilo river, but another parallel
to it, or a branch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus6">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Riding a Carabao.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_78"><i>To face page 78.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>There we got out and walked down the steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
bank on to the sandy bed, where we strolled about
for a long time, watching strings of <i lang="es">carabaos</i>
coming up from being watered, each herd led
by a small boy, riding on one of the big old
grey cows with a calf running alongside. They
looked very picturesque, with the shallow river
all the colours of the sunset, and the tall palms
on the opposite bank standing in black silhouette
against an orange-crimson sky.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">carabaos</i> are big grey or reddish-grey
water-buffaloes, with immense horns curving
backwards, and a long, narrow, flat muzzle.
They are used for every sort of purpose, the
natives even riding and driving the great unwieldy
creatures like horses, and guiding them by
means of a single string passed through between
the nostrils. If they want the <i lang="es">carabao</i> to go to
the right they pull the string steadily, if to the
left, they give a sharp jerk. Sometimes when
the master is angry he will pull the poor
<i lang="es">carabao’s</i> nose, so that he tears the piece of
flesh out altogether; not at all an uncommon
occurrence, and nothing distressing to a Filipino.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
In the days of the rebellion against Spain, a
few years ago, when the Filipinos caught the
hated Spanish friars, they ran a rope through
the priests’ noses, tied their hands, and led them
about like the <i lang="es">carabaos</i>, so that people might
spit upon the hated tyrants, and insult them
at their own pleasure.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">carabaos</i> are as gentle and amenable as
horses with the natives; quite tiny children ride
and bully the huge beasts, looking so comically
small on the big backs, with their tiny brown
legs hardly reaching to each side of the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ribs, and driving whole herds with the most
perfect independence and self-possession. The
<i lang="es">carabaos</i> are not at all safe as regards white
people, however, for they can smell and detect
them at an immense distance; and they will occasionally
charge them ferociously, so that they
are very dangerous in the open country. I have
heard some horrible stories of <i lang="es">carabaos</i> killing and
trampling on white men in out-of-the-way places.
They don’t gore, I suppose because their horns
are so flat, but they trample to death, which does
just as well.</p>

<p>These great grey, lumbering animals are very
picturesque, and redeem many a Philippine scene
from utter dulness as they go shambling along,
drawing the native two-wheeled cart, with its big
hood of brown matting filled with bundles of
emerald-green <i lang="es">sacate</i> grass. They can shamble
at an amazing pace, and that is their usual gait;
but they can gallop, too, as quickly as a horse.</p>

<p>Besides the herds of <i lang="es">carabaos</i>, we saw several
natives down in the bed of the river, going out
to certain spots where the shelve of the sand
was more abrupt for their supply of water. These
were women, of course, for women do all the
household tasks, even the most burdensome,
their lords being busy standing about the roads
or Plazas, or attending a cock-fight.</p>

<p>These women had long bamboo poles, with
the divisions knocked out and the end closed up,
which they laid in the running stream to fill with
water, when they hoisted the long poles to their
shoulders and carried them off like giants’ lances.
The slender little figures looked quaint and pretty
as they came up over the yellow, sandy, shallows
in their bright red <i lang="es">sarongs</i> and white <i lang="es">camisas</i>,
walking lightly and gracefully, with their thin
brown feet well turned out, the fading light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the sky behind them, and the outline of dark,
fretted palms.</p>

<p>We walked through a little palm grove back
to the place where we had left the carriage,
driving back along the main road as the stars
were coming out and the flaring naphtha lights
appearing in the little mat-shed shops. There
were a great many people about, and swarms of
little children in fluttering muslin shirts, all enjoying
the cool evening air, which was, as a matter
of fact, the same temperature as an August mid-day
at home. A lot of carriages and traps flew past,
the little ponies tearing like the wind, amongst
them the general’s wife in her victoria, drawn
by ordinary Waler horses, looking like prehistoric
monsters amongst the little Filipino ponies; and
we met our pet aversion, three young <i lang="es">Mestizo</i>
“mashers,” driving at a furious pace in a spidery
buggy with huge acetylene lamps, and ringing a
bicycle bell.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOME RESULTS OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>January 22, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>Mail-day has come round again, but I don’t
feel as though I had much energy for writing,
or anything else, as we are in the midst of a
heat-wave, which means, in this part of the world,
that the Monsoon has dropped unaccountably, and
the heat is suffocating and appalling. Everyone
is saying that such a temperature is quite unusual
at this season, and some even go so far as to say
they never felt it so hot here before; but this does
not surprise me, as I have never yet come in for
normal weather anywhere.</p>

<p>This heat comes in the middle of a drought,
too, as we have not had rain for about four weeks—another
phenomenon. Our rain-tank is empty,
so we now depend on the supply of brackish water
from the wells, and even that is reported to be
limited, which is alarming, as one would commit
almost any crime to get enough water for a bath.
Even at times of plenty, however, one does not
rejoice in the European style of bath, but an
arrangement of a tub, the acquaintance of which
I first made at Singapore, and I can’t say I was
much struck with it when I did see it.</p>

<p>The tub, of wood or china, is placed in a small
room with a sloping floor of concrete or tiles, and
the bather stands on a wooden rack; first using
what soap he sees fit, and then pouring water over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
himself as best he can with a tin dipper. It is an
economical method in countries where water is
scarce and valuable; but it was a terrible disillusion
to me, after the grand ideas I had always
formed, when I read how every one in the Far East
has his or her own bathroom. Don’t you know
how jolly it sounds in Anglo-Indian novels, or in
descriptions of the world beyond Port Saïd? A
dreadful disenchantment!</p>

<p>More than ever, in this heat, do we miss
the dog-cart of our dreams, for we long to
get out of the town on these hot evenings.
Something to drive is a bare necessity of life out
here, and even the humblest school-teachers and
missionaries keep what the Americans call a “rig,”
such a queer word, which is made to signify anything
from a four-in-hand to a <i lang="es">carabao</i>-cart. The
Americans all drive in a very strange fashion, holding
a rein in each hand, which looks awkward at
any time; but is most comical in the case of the
swaggering negro who drives the military waggons,
holding in a team about as fiery as a couple of old
circus-horses, with a rein twisted round each of
his hands, body thrown back, and the gestures of a
Greek restraining an untamed pair round a stadium.</p>

<p>The white man who drives the Government
ice-cart amuses me too, for he is got up in
full cow-boy pageantry—huge boots, loose shirt
with broad leather belt, immense sombrero worn
well over one eye, long moustaches standing out,
and great gauntlets up to his elbows. All this to
hawk ice about a dowdy little town.</p>

<p>When a soldier rides one of these quiet old
animals, he sits in an enormous Mexican saddle,
with a very high peak back and front, and his
feet, clad in big boots with huge spurs, thrust into
roomy leather shoe-stirrups. To the casual observer
these horsemen would certainly convey the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that they were venturing great deeds in a
wild country, and one can’t be anything but thankful
to them for throwing a little picturesque relief
into the humdrum life of the grey streets.</p>

<p>We have tried hiring carriages, but besides the
terrible discomfort of all hired vehicles, their prices
are more uncomfortable still. Fancy, in a place
like this, having to pay as much for a little carriage
for two hours in the evening as one would for a
brougham in London for the day! Yet such is the
case, and it is only an indication of the cost of
living here, which is really alarming; as you may
imagine it must be when I tell you that all the
Americans I have met complain bitterly, declaring
that it is more expensive to <em>exist</em> in the Philippines
than to “have a good time” in New York or San
Francisco! The only comfort is that we are not in
Manila, which is a shade worse, I am told.</p>

<p>So, except for an occasional carriage lent us,
we continue to walk about after sunset, but I find
I can’t get very far, for though exercise may not
be very tiring at the time it is being taken, it
makes you realise how the climate is taking it out
of you.</p>

<p>There is no meeting-place like the club of an
English garrison town, for the Americans seem to
have no idea of anything of the sort; and I think
this may, perhaps, be owing to their democratic
principles, for, of course, it would be impossible to
exclude the private soldiers from such a place, as
in theory they are as good as the officers. I notice
that in practice the officers don’t think so at all,
though most of them have risen from the ranks
themselves. The U.S.A. have a sort of Sandhurst,
called West Point, but I have been told, by highly-placed
officers themselves, that the only way to get
on in their army is to obtain a commission from
the ranks through “pull” (political influence), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that “pull” is even more a factor in the army than
in any other profession in America. This can
easily be verified by reading the extraordinary cases
that occur from time to time, when an officer with
a “pull” gets the decision of a Court-Martial
reversed without any further controversy, and,
after an undoubted misdemeanour, is simply
re-instated somewhere else, and often in a higher
grade, by order of the Government at Washington.</p>

<p>This independence of military authority, together
with the principles of extreme democracy which
America professes, accounts, I think, for the curious
behaviour of the private soldiers, who are really
quite different from any others I have seen anywhere
else in the world, for they lounge about
when addressing an officer, and speak to him as
an equal; which looks more than odd to anyone
not accustomed to such ways. Men who were here
during the American War have told me most amusing
stories of the discussions that used to go on
between officers and privates on active service; all
straggling about anyhow, and men, with no notion
of saluting, just giving their opinion with a drawling
“waal” by way of preface. All the same, they
fight well, and perhaps, in modern warfare, individual
intelligence may be a very good thing, and
it is only in peace time that a lack of smartness
and discipline jars upon the faddy European eye.
Perhaps.</p>

<p>But the oddest thing of all, to my mind, is to
see officers in uniform salute ladies by taking their
caps off. That I can’t get accustomed to!</p>

<p>I call this a garrison town, though, as a matter
of fact, the garrison is situated in the Island of
Guimaras, at a place called Camp Josman, in the
interior. This Camp, which is about 200 feet
above sea-level, and possesses springs of good
water, is supposed to be much healthier than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Iloilo, where they only have the Hospital, Headquarters,
and the Cavalry Barracks. It seems a
strange and uncomfortable arrangement in a half-pacified
country—the garrison half a day’s journey
away; though the real object is, of course, to keep
the American soldiers out of the towns, where they
are no end of trouble.</p>

<p>The town is well and even elaborately policed
by the Constabulary, a Filipino corps of sturdy
little “brown brothers” in dark blue linen suits.
Each of these defenders supports an immense
revolver in a leather case strapped to the back of
his broad leather belt, and carries a short truncheon
as well. I suppose they would fight all right, in
reason, if there were a disturbance, and if the
occasion were not of a patriotic nature. But that
is not much consolation, as the occasion would
not be likely to be of any character other than
patriotic.</p>

<p>The Americans give out and write in their
papers that the Philippine Islands are completely
pacified, and that the Filipinos love Americans and
their rule. This, doubtless with good motives, is
complete and utter humbug, for the country is
honeycombed with insurrection and plots; the
fighting has never ceased; and the natives loathe
the Americans and their theories, saying so openly
in their native press, and showing their dislike in
every possible fashion. Their one idea is to be
rid of the U.S.A. to have their government in
their own hands, for good or evil, and to be free
of a burden of taxation which may be just, but is
heavier than any the Spaniards laid upon them.
The present burden is more obvious to the Filipino
mind than the ultimate blessings.</p>

<p>They have no real say in their own affairs, you
see, as the government of the Philippines is in
the hands of a Commission consisting of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Americans, nominated by the President of the
U.S.A. and three Filipinos, chosen by the
Governor-General of the Philippines.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This body,
however, does not govern the Islands according
to what experience teaches, but is responsible to
the Senate at Washington, whose members having
their own interests to push or preserve, hamper the
Philippine Commission at every turn.</p>

<p>It does seem extraordinary to think that
there is no Colonial Office, or Civil Service examinations,
and that anyone in America who has a
“pull” can get sent out here to fill any sort of
post anyhow, anywhere. Tremendous salaries
come out of the miserable Island Revenues to
make these posts acceptable. So it is hardly
surprising that, without the faintest glimmering
of the language, customs, climate, or anything
beyond their own State, these eager, well-meaning,
bustling Americans tumble into pitfalls, and rub
the Oriental the wrong way, and that the dislike
and mistrust on both sides are about equal.</p>

<p>I did not mean to let you in for this political
dissertation, but now I am on the subject I am
reminded of a new tax, which has lately been
levied, and is causing much vexation. It will give
you a good idea of the methods in vogue. This is
an order requiring every owner of a horse to take
his beast to the Philippine Government, or rather
its local and selected representatives, who will
brand the animal on one flank with certain marks
by which it may at once be known. Then the
owner is to brand it twice on the other flank, and
to find two sureties of 250 dollars gold (about £50)
each, that the horse has not been stolen, and
should the animal prove to have been dishonestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
acquired, the sureties are to be held criminally
liable!</p>

<p>This in a country where the crime of horse-stealing
is entirely unknown! But it is believed
that the Senators in far-off Washington have an
idea that the Philippines are a sort of California,
so they insist on applying exactly the same law here
as obtains in that wide, wild State. It is hardly
necessary to add that the examination, branding,
papers to be signed, stamps upon same, and so on,
cost the wretched owner a pretty sum before he is
safe from the police with his poor, disfigured horse.</p>

<p>I have wandered away from a walk through
the town, which I meant to describe to you—only
I never seem to get ahead at all with descriptions
here, as there are such endless mazes of side-issues
to lure one from the track.</p>

<p>At the end of this street one comes on the
Plaza, a very wide square bordered by odds and
ends of houses, which include the Police Court, the
Y.M.C.A., the Prison, and the Cathedral, the three
former buildings being large, ordinary, two-storied
houses, the latter a big, plain, grey stone front,
with a belfry on each side, not unlike a miniature
of the cathedral at Las Palmas, and, as far as I
remember, in much the same style.</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_89"><i>To face page 89.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The town must have been quite handsome in
the Spanish days, but during the Insurrection the
Americans stood off and bombarded it from the
open sea, while on shore the natives set it on
fire. You see, when the Americans had conquered
the Spaniards, and the Philippines had been
handed over to the United States, the Spanish
garrisons cleared out, leaving the Filipinos in
charge to wait for their saviours. But the
Filipinos beginning to realise that they had only
sailed from Scylla to Charybdis, fought tooth
and nail to prevent the American troops garrisoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
their towns. So it came about that when the
Americans had officially conquered the Spaniards,
and <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> and rejoicings were in full blast in the
U.S.A., the trouble here was really only just
beginning, for though they had managed to dislodge
an alien race like the Spaniards with the
full help and concurrence of the natives of the
country, it was a very different task to conquer
the disaffected people of the soil, even when it
was being done “for their own good.” When
the American fleet came to take Iloilo, the
Filipinos showed fight, and the American Admiral
said they must give up the place or he would
bombard it, allowing them so many hours to
decide in—which hours, by-the-bye, were not
unconnected with some complication regarding
the Christmas dinners of the sailors, who insisted
on eating plum-puddings they had brought with
them, or had had sent from America. Well, the
Filipinos replied that the Americans might come
ashore and fight if they liked, but if the Admiral
bombarded the town, they would set it on fire, and
make Iloilo not worth the taking.</p>

<p>The end of this exchange of courtesies was that
the Admiral chose the alternative of bombardment,
whereupon the Filipinos promptly fired the town,
and Iloilo was pretty well destroyed, and eventually
taken for the Stars and Stripes. The loss of
life was one mule and one old woman, neither of
whom probably cared two straws who the Philippines
belonged to, poor things.</p>

<p>One or two people were wounded, but this was
only another instance of the extraordinarily small
amount of damage done by a bombardment. I
have heard many curious “yarns” about the
bombardment and the fire, which took place on
Christmas Day, 1899, but I have not time or space
to tell you these legends now, even if I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
remember them. I wish I could remember all the
things I hear—though, I daresay, I remember quite
enough for you as it is!</p>

<p>The chief feature of the bombardment stories is
the terrible drunkenness and looting that went on;
but even if those anecdotes interested you, they are
all connected with personal adventures of people
you have never met, and would not entertain you.
I am glad I was not here though, for the anarchy
and misery seem to have been terrible.</p>

<p>Many results of these stirring times still remain
in the streets, for the top stories of the houses were
knocked off and the stone foundations gutted, and
when the people settled down peaceably again,
there was no money to restore the buildings to
their former state, so they just put rough rooms
over the charred ruins, makeshift upper stories of
Oregon pine with corrugated iron roofs, which
arrangement makes the town look very shoddy and
unfinished. In Jaro and Molo are to be seen many
of the handsome old Spanish houses still standing,
with carved wooden balconies and ornamented
doorways, some of them still beautified by deep
roofs of charming old red-brown hand-made tiles.</p>

<p>There is a <i lang="fr">café</i> in the Plaza Libertad, in what
was once a big, fine house, but now the thick concrete
walls of the lower storey, with huge doorways
and window-openings crossed by heavy bars, all
blackened with smoke, end abruptly in a narrow-eaved
corrugated roof, making a house like a misshapen
little dwarf.</p>

<p>There are many buildings like that, and in the
streets the jumble of different sorts of odds and
ends is most curious, but not the least picturesque,
for it is all grey and mean and squalid.</p>

<p>All the middle of the square, which, as I told
you, is called the Plaza Libertad, is laid out as a
pretty Alameda, with a low wall round it, and steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
leading up on each side, the centre thickly planted
with palms, bamboos, and various other trees of
dark and light greens, intersected by four wide
paths and a lot of little tracks, all bristling with
seats. Some of the seats are of wood, broken and
dilapidated, and others of iron painted to look like
marble, which are quite warm to the touch hours
after sunset. The first evening we were there,
when I put my hand on one of the iron seats,
thinking to touch cold stone, I got quite a shock
on finding the surface warm.</p>

<p>This flowerless garden is a very pretty place,
especially at night, when the big arc-lights shine on
the very green trees, and throw lovely shadows of
palm branches on the white paths, making quite a
theatrical effect; but it is all overgrown, untidy,
neglected, the steps broken, paths untrimmed—always
reminding me of some place in a deserted
city, or the garden of a house long uninhabited.</p>

<p>The Plaza Libertad has one resemblance to a
real town park, however, in its rows of idle men;
brown-faced, white-clad Filipinos in this case, who
sit on the seats and low walls like rows of sea-birds,
only, instead of making nests or catching food
as birds would, they simply doze, and gamble, and
talk, or, more often, sit about in the profound
abstraction of the Oriental.</p>

<p>The “unemployed” has no grievance against
society, however, in this country, if he ever tries
to attempt one, for work is abundant and labour
not to be had, even at the present scale of wages,
which enables a man to work for one day and
then keep himself and his family to the remotest
scions, in idleness and cock-fighting for a week.
You see in the Spanish days the Philipino
labourers got from 10 to 20 cents a day wages
but now the American Government, which sets
the scale, gives a <i lang="es">peso</i> a day for unskilled labour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and that, of course, has altered the social conditions
here, and, I believe, all over the Islands
as well, for the same conditions prevail everywhere.
A <i lang="es">peso</i> a day they get for loading and unloading
vessels—just wharf-coolies; and as for carpenters
and people like that who used to get 70 cents from
the Spaniards and live well on it, they are now
with difficulty to be caught for 2½ to 3 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a day.
Of course this has enormously increased the cost of
living without bringing any extra benefits, but that
particular increase chiefly affects the white man, for
I have asked servants and natives, who tell me the
cost of <em>their</em> food, the eternal rice, fish, and bananas
for them has very little altered, if at all.</p>

<p>The high rate of wages, far from bringing plenty,
has caused great demoralisation and consequent
poverty; and it does seem a pity that some one
who understood Orientals and their ways could not
have come and pointed out to the Americans how
dark races differ from white men in body and
mind. As it is, I should think that even if the
well-meaning reformers do find out their mistakes,
which is very doubtful, it would be very difficult,
if not impossible, for the Americans to go back
now.</p>

<p>On one side of the Plaza there stand a few
specimens of the funny native trap called a <i lang="es">quilez</i>,
which I have mentioned to you. It is very like the
<i lang="es">tartana</i> of Spain, a sort of tiny wagonette on two
wheels, and covered so that it is really a sort of
miniature two-wheeled omnibus.</p>

<p>Such a cabstand! Such fearfully dilapidated
old rattle-traps, with mangy ponies lashed in by
odds and ends of straps and string, and the drivers
dressed in dirty rags (the only dirty Filipinos I’ve
ever seen) sprawling half-asleep on the boxes! This
collection, as I have said, is by way of being a cab-rank,
but there are always plenty of <i lang="es">quilezes</i> plying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the streets for hire; their number indeed being at
first astounding, till one becomes better acquainted
with the laziness of the fares, coupled with the high
rates of hire, which alone would make one job a
day quite a good investment.</p>

<p>The discomfort and jolting of these conveyances
is something which I can find no words to express
—it is like one’s first ride on a camel—like waltzing
with a Sandhurst cadet—like—like nothing in the
world! A drive of one mile inside a <i lang="es">quilez</i> is more
fatiguing than a walk of two.</p>

<p>One thinks regretfully of the delightful luxury
of the rickshaws and chairs of the real Far East,
and I was very much surprised to see none of these
luxurious comforts when we first arrived in the
Philippines. It seems that a company was formed
some years ago to introduce them, and got the
concession to bring rickshaws and coolies from
China, but as soon as these useful institutions
appeared in the streets of Manila, the Filipinos
stoned them, and at last forced the American
authorities to banish the innovation altogether:
“For,” said the astute and progressive Filipino,
“the next thing will be that <em>we</em> shall be made to
draw these things about, and we will not be treated
as animals.”</p>

<p>Fancy giving in to them! And fancy thinking
of a splendid country and people like Japan,
“where the rickshaws come from,” and listening to
such preposterous nonsense from a Filipino! But
these ignorant half-breeds got their way, and the
only example they had ever had of energy or the
real dignity of labour was promptly withdrawn to
please them.</p>

<p>In the middle of the Alameda is a bandstand,
bare and empty, with a big spluttering arc-light
over it, shedding its cheese-white light on nothingness—for
no band ever plays there, and the glories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of social Iloilo went with the gay and courteous
Spaniards. A few people go and sit about, however,
in the evenings, and it is not a bad place to
loaf in for anyone who can’t drive out to the country
and is tired of the beach.</p>

<p>One evening, as we sat under the trees watching
a group of <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> children playing about some
older people sitting on a seat, a little <i lang="es">banda de
musica</i> came strolling by, half a dozen young
Filipinos in white trousers and <i lang="es">camisas</i>, carrying
mandolins and guitars. They stopped near to
where the children were playing, and struck up a
certain beautiful waltz which one hears everywhere
here—the work of some native composer, I believe—whereupon
the little things all danced about on
the white path in the fretted shadows of the trees,
making a perfectly charming picture, and all so
happy and jolly it did one good to watch them, in
spite of the excessive heat.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">banda de musica</i> seemed to enjoy the fun
too, for they smiled and showed their white teeth;
speaking to the children and playing one tune after
the other; and when we had to go home in time for
dinner, we left them still dancing and playing under
the trees, perfectly happy, even at that age, with
anything in the nature of a <i lang="es">baile</i>.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_12">LETTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CHINESE NEW YEAR—LABOUR CONDITIONS—A
CINÉMATOGRAPH SHOW</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>February 4, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>To-day is the Chinese New Year, and all last night
the Chinamen were letting off crackers down in the
town. All to-day they have been going on with
them, too, and as the chief rejoicing seems to be to
explode the fireworks under a horse, you may
imagine—no you can’t—what the streets are like.
On an ordinary day there is a good deal of pretty
wild driving and no small peril in getting about in a
vehicle or on foot, but the frightful risks one runs
on every other day of the year are mild adventures
compared to this Chinese New Year.</p>

<p>There are a great many Chinamen, you see, for
they continue to come into the Philippines in spite
of the heavy tax against them; and besides that, so
many are left over from the Spanish days that
Celestials are still the principal shopkeepers of the
Islands. They make large fortunes here, I believe—the
fortunes that are ready waiting for anyone who
is as clever and industrious as a Chinaman—and so
good a speculation do they think this country that
they are constantly arriving, whenever they can get
permission, paying the heavy tax, and then beginning
by working for a year or two with some friend
or relation for no pay!</p>

<p>Of course, the Filipinos hate the idea of being
cut out by strong, hard-working, clever rivals, who
make fortunes under conditions in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
themselves starve, so they have forced the hand
of the American Government in abolishing foreign
labour, which measure, so the business men say,
has been the ruin of the Philippines. They say
that such a law is wise enough in a country
like America, perhaps, which is teeming with a
busy population of its own, but here it is quite
different, and “Philippines for the Filipinos” would
be all very well if these people wanted their country,
which does not seem to be the case. Moreover,
if they did want it, it is too large for them, for
there are 75,000,000 acres of cultivable soil in the
Philippines, and the population <em>all told</em> is barely
7,000,000. Suppose one calculated one in ten of the
natives of all ages as a capable tiller of the earth—a
<em>most</em> unlikely average—and <em>if</em> three Filipinos
could do the work of one Chinaman or white man
(which they can’t), even then one would think there
would be room for competition and other labour.</p>

<p>The magnificent forests of priceless woods
simply fall into decay; the gold and all the metals
with which the country is filled, lie untouched; the
marbles are unquarried; the rich soil is uncultivated;
and so these riches must remain as long as it
pays no one to work them. Men often come to the
Philippines to “prospect,” but when they find out
the conditions of labour and the rate of Export
and other Duties, they go away and are no more
heard of; for, though you may run a sort of
Government with philanthropical ideas, you won’t
get business to flow in on the same system; and
business men don’t care two straws if a labourer
can read Latin or understand mathematics, so long
as he will work well for low wages; but this latter
ideal is the very last one the American Government
appear to encourage or aim at.</p>

<p>Well, we went last night to a cinématograph
show, which has established itself in a big empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
basement in the Calle Real, with a large sign
outside, made of glass letters lighted behind with
electricity, all in the most approved European style.
The “show” lasts for half an hour, going on from
six in the evening to about ten o’clock at night, and
the proprietor makes about 300 <i lang="es">pesos</i> a week out of
it, for he has very few expenses, and it is the sort of
thing these people love. They come out when the
show is over, stand about and expectorate for a few
minutes, and then pay their cents and go in again
and enjoy the same thing about five times running,
probably without the faintest idea what it is all
about from start to finish. You remember the
dreadful extent of the habit of expectoration in
Spain? You have heard about this failing in
America? The Filipino is the epitome and concentration
of the two.</p>

<p>Everything in the hall was boarded up to
prevent any stray, non-paying enthusiast from
getting a free peep; but all the same I saw several
little brown forms in fluttering muslin shirts,
outside, where the wall formed a side street, with
eyes glued to the chinks of a door in rapt
attention; though I don’t suppose the little chaps
could really see anything but the extreme edge of
the back row of benches.</p>

<p>In the hall we were saved from suffocation by
two electric fans, and kept awake by a Filipino
playing a cracked old piano with astonishing
dexterity, rattling out the sort of tunes you hear
in a circus and nowhere else on earth. I could not
help wondering where he had picked them up, till
it suddenly dawned on me that one, at least, gave
me a faint hint that perhaps the performer might
once have heard “Hiawatha” on a penny flute;
so I concluded that he was playing “variations.”
Pianos never sound very well out here, and I am
told it is difficult to keep them bearable at all, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the chords have an unmusical way of going rusty in
the damp season, or else snapping with a loud <em>ping</em>.</p>

<p>The moving pictures were not at all bad, rather
jumpy at times, but the subjects really quite
entertaining, and all the slides, from the appearance
of the figures on them, made in Germany, I
imagine. The series wound up with an interminable
fairy tale in coloured pictures, really a sort
of short play, and in this one could see the German
element still more apparent, in the castles, the
ancient costumes, and the whole composition of
the thing. I don’t suppose the natives in the
audience had the wildest idea what it was all
about, or what the king and queen, the good
fairy, and the wicked godmother, were meant to be,
probably taking the whole story for some episode
in the life of a Saint.</p>

<p>The audience were really more amusing to me
than the pictures, and I was quite pleased each
time the light went up so that I could have a good
look at them. In the front rows, which were cheap,
as they were so close to the screen, sat the poorer
people in little family groups, with clean <i lang="es">camisas</i>
and large cigars, the women’s hair looking like
black spun glass. Our places were raised a little
above them, and were patronised by the swells who
had paid 40 cents—a shilling. Amongst the elect
were one or two English and other foreigners; some
fat Chinamen, with their pigtails done up in chignons,
and wearing open-work German straw hats, accompanied
by their native wives and little slant-eyed
children; a few missionaries and schoolma’ams in
coloured blouses and untidy coiffures <i lang="fr">à la</i> Gibson
Girl; and one or two U.S.A. soldiers, with thick
hair parted in the middle, standing treat to their
Filipina girls—these last in pretty <i lang="es">camisas</i>, and very
shy and happy. A funny little Filipino boy near us,
rigged up in a knickerbocker suit and an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
yellow oil-skin motor-cap, was rather frightened at
old Tuyay, who had insisted on coming to the show
and sitting at our feet. When she sniffed the bare
legs of this very small brown brother, he lost all his
dignity and importance, and clung blubbing to his
little flat-faced mother. Poor old Tuyay was
dreadfully offended; she came and crawled right
under C——’s chair, where she lay immovable till
the performance was over.</p>

<p>To watch the people here is an endless source
of amusement to me, and I only wish my words
could be more photographic, or our photographs
more pictorial, so that I could convey to you a
real impression of this queer end of the world.
That is what it is—I feel as if I had arrived at
the end of the world, where nobody cares or knows
or hears or thinks of anything, and where the
inertia that is in the very air of things will at
last wear down even the vitality, pluck, and good
intentions of the Americans themselves.</p>

<p>I have arranged to go to Manila on the 28th,
to-morrow three weeks, by the <i>Butuan</i>, the weekly
mail. We heard fearful reports of these steamers,
as I told you, when we were leaving Manila, but
unfortunately there is no other means of getting
to Manila from here. I am very glad it is arranged
that I am to go, and I am looking forward very
much to the change of air and scene. C—— is
very anxious for me to take a servant to wait on
me, for ladies generally take a native retainer
with them when they travel about; but I won’t
hear of such extravagance, and think I shall have
far less trouble with only myself to look after, and
without the extra burden of a bewildered Filipino.
A friend of ours came from Manila the other day
on a visit, with one of these appanages of state in
her wake, and he seemed to me to be more trouble
than the whole journey was worth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><i lang="fr">À propos</i> of servants, we had an amusing and
very characteristic adventure with the cook a day
or two ago, when it occurred to us that for some
time past we had not seen what we thought was
the worth of a <i lang="es">peso</i> and a half of food appearing
on the table, and nearly all the dishes seemed to be
concocted from ingredients out of the <i lang="es">dispensa</i>;
and eggs which, tiny though they are, cost the
same as fresh-laid ones of ordinary size at home.
What is more, they go bad so quickly that the
price is really more, because so many have to be
thrown away. Well, C—— said to the cook quite
amiably that that functionary must revert to his
original plan of giving us a daily list of his expenses,
and the cook replied, very sulkily, “<i lang="es">Si señor</i>.”</p>

<p>Next morning, when I was giving out stores,
the cook said:</p>

<p>“I should like to leave the <i lang="es">señora’s</i> service
to-morrow. I can’t read or write, as the <i lang="es">señora</i>
knows, and the cook downstairs, who used to do
my list for me, has gone away.”</p>

<p>Of course I knew every word of this to be an
utter lie, and that my wily friend was only “trying
it on,” as they say, because he knew it would be
very inconvenient for us to dismiss him before I went
to Manila. But I did not flatter him or “play up”
to him by looking the least surprised or put out;
I merely answered, very gravely and politely:
“Certainly, <i lang="es">cocinero</i>, that will suit us perfectly. I
will see about your wages.”</p>

<p>Such a look of utter disgust and surprise
came over his monkey-face—exactly like Brookes’
monkey with the frying-pan—but I said nothing,
and went on serving out potatoes and tinned fruit,
and giving orders as to how I wished to have the
things cooked.</p>

<p>When C—— came home and heard this
domestic history, he wanted to go and find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
cook, and call him and his ancestry every name
under the sun; but I implored him not to pander
to the creature’s vanity by such a compliment as
letting him think for one instant that we wished
him to stay. So no words were said; but we
observed that the <i lang="fr">menu</i> was immensely improved.</p>

<p>Next morning, when Domingo came for the
cook’s marketing money, instead of sending it
out, I went out myself and said: “Well, do
you want the <i lang="es">gastos</i> money or your wages?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the cook, with a regular sort
of rogue’s way he has of looking you straight
in the eye, “I will take the <i lang="es">gastos</i>. I will remain
with the <i lang="es">señora</i> to-day, as I see she has not
been able to get another cook.”</p>

<p>Inwardly I gasped; but I thought it better
not to take any notice of such impudence, so I
pretended I had not understood what he had
said, and replied that I was very sorry he had
not been able to find another situation, and
that the <i lang="es">señor</i> would permit him to stay on.
He opened his mouth as if he were going to
answer, but evidently changed his mind, for he
said nothing, but just held out his hand for the
money.</p>

<p>Since which skirmish he has given us better
food, and better cooked than we have ever had
from him, and a daily list of expenses is handed
to me without comment.</p>

<p>I hope I don’t bore you with my simple
domestic stories? But this one I felt I must
really tell you, as it is so absolutely characteristic
of the half “cute” Filipino.</p>

<p>Talking of native characters, there is a strange
but very typical hairdresser along our street,
with one poor-looking little room opening on to
the road as his whole shop. All the barbers
here do their business in the evenings, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
their saloons may be seen brightly lighted, with men
inside being operated on, while others loaf and
gossip, but we have never seen a sign of a customer
in our neighbour’s little shop. Perhaps he does
business in the day time, and though we doubt
it, we always hope this is the case. In the
evenings his door stands wide open, and inside,
the barber is to be seen lying back in an old
armchair, with his bare feet on the basin, playing
an old fiddle in absolute peace and contentment,
while he watches his reflection in a big looking-glass.</p>

<p>In a sort of wild and whimsical way he
makes me think of The Lady of Shalott, and
I fancy that some day a real customer will come
riding by, when the mirror will “crack from side
to side,” and the hairdresser will look out and
see the world as it really is, and just die of
misery.</p>

<p>But I am sure that as long as he sits and plays
like that, it would be a thousand pities if anyone
came in with foolish and mundane ideas about
shaving chins or cutting hair.</p>

<p>The burst of heat I told you of, is over, and
the days are cool again, by comparison. Also,
last night rain fell, and we got some water in
our tank, after the preliminary excitement of
diverting the pipe to let the dirt wash off the
roof. This is a most important consideration,
and as the servants are very apt to leave the
pipe over the cistern, instead of moving it, so
that when rain comes the first dirt will run
away, one has to turn out at any hour of the
day or night, when rain begins to rattle on the
roofs. And how these tropical showers do rattle
and roar, so that one cannot hear the other
speak without “hailing the main top,” as papa
would call it.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_13">LETTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOME INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE, SCENERY,
AND RELIGION</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>February 18, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>You must excuse my writing still being rather bad,
as my illness has left me so weak that I shall not
be out of bed for some days longer, in fact I am
beginning to be fearfully afraid that I may not be
well enough to go to Manila on the 28th after all.
However, I have ten days to get well in, which
gives me hope, and my progress so far has been
simply wonderful, which is due to the extraordinary
luck I have had in finding such good doctors and
such a charming and clever nurse.</p>

<p>I am much disappointed in having missed the
visit of a U.S.A. man-of-war, the <i>Rainbow</i>, which
is on a cruise through the Islands, and has come
here for a couple of days. She is the flagship of
the squadron the Americans keep in the China
seas, and a very fine ship, I believe.</p>

<p>Last night her crew gave a sing-song in the
theatre, to which I persuaded C—— to go, and was
very glad I had done so, as he enjoyed it immensely,
and says it was a very good sort of Christy Minstrel
“show.” It ended with a small play, done by
real “American Negroes,” as they are called.
The <i>Rainbow</i> gave the same entertainment in
Hong Kong, just before we arrived, and I heard
then how good it was. This afternoon we have
been invited to a reception to be held on board,
but, of course, that also is out of the question for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
me, and C—— will be busy at the office till very
late.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of work at the office now,
as the chief business in this island is sugar, and
this is the height of the “season,” when great
loads of thousands of sacks go out every day to
be put into steamers and sailing vessels off the
estuary. They have a rough factory here where
the cane is crushed, and the stuff exported is a
thick, brown sort of sand (<em>don’t</em> make a joke about
sand and sugar!), a great deal of which goes to
Europe and America, but most to Hong Kong,
where it is refined in great factories. The refined
sugar that comes back from Hong Kong is what
we buy here; and, though an English company has
started a sugar refinery in Manila, they find that
the conditions of trade in the Philippines are such
that they can only <em>just</em> compete with the stuff
refined elsewhere and imported subject to the
export tax and the enormous duties.</p>

<p>I think I am very lucky in having such a nice
room to be ill in. It is very large and shady, with
three windows and two doors, and I look out on
a bright garden belonging to the house opposite,
and a green field and trees, which is charming.
Through the trees are glimpses of the grey backs of
the houses in the street parallel to this, and then a
thick, high belt of palms, which hides the open sea.</p>

<p>This is the S.-W. side of the house. The back,
to the N.-E., looks out across a rough garden of
fresh, thick grass to half a mile or so of shallows,
where the tide fluctuates, and beyond is the
strip of blue river, which looks so narrow seen
from here that the big steamers which go by seem
to be sailing on dry land. Beyond, again, comes a
fringe of bright green palms, and then the open
sea—a stretch of darkest blue—and a bit of hilly,
verdant Guimaras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>I think one of the great beauties of the views
here is that the sky is never quite cloudless—there
are always very white clouds somewhere in the dome
of intense blue, which give relief and value to all
the colours below.</p>

<p>On days when the Monsoon is not too high, we
open the shutters looking towards the river, but
these open wooden slats keep the houses quite cool,
even when the shutters are closed. I wish there
were something like the <em>tatties</em> of India; but no one
out here has ever heard of such a thing. The open
shutters are very nice though, and the view framed
in the dark opening which faces us at table is like
looking at a large, bright picture. Sometimes the
tide is right up to the garden wall, the sky cloudy,
and the water like slate. At other times, when it
is far out, the shallows turn into mud-flats, with
groups of native women wading about in their
bright red clothes, looking for mysterious fish which
Filipinos alone dare eat and live.</p>

<p>Some friends from Manila were looking out of
the hall window a little time ago, and said, “What
a lovely view. I should never tire of that.” I said
we never did, which was quite true.</p>

<p>When I am well again, and if C—— can get
away, I hope to be able to go beyond the roads to
Jaro and Molo, though they are beautiful and
inexhaustible. With all the beauty, however, I begin
to have the same sort of feeling about this country
that that old friend of ours, General R——, had
about the girl at the Aldershot ball. You remember
the story he told us of how he saw her exquisite
face across the ball-room, and insisted on a common
friend introducing him to her? And when he and
the friend had got half way across the ball-room, the
old general said: “Stop! Take me away. Get
me out of it. Her face has never changed and
never can change. It isn’t a face. It’s a mask,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sir, a mask! It is not a human being. Come
away!”</p>

<p>Well, I feel like that about Philippine scenery,
which can be dark or light according to the
reflections thrown on it, but it has never changed,
and even if there is a slight change, when that has
passed it will always and for ever be the same
greens and the same blue. No alternation to red
and yellow autumn, no brown and purple winter,
no delicate spring—nothing but perpetual, chromo-lithograph
mid-summer, which has always seemed
to me the least beautiful season of the year.</p>

<p>When the wet Monsoon blows, I believe that
season is counted as a sort of spring, for various
trees then come into bloom, but, for the great part,
everything just goes on growing and dying, and
growing and dying in dull routine, like the natives.
In fact I often think the much-abused Filipino is
only a prototype, as it were, a sort of reflection, of
his country. It seems as if this were so, too, for
those who go away to Hong Kong or Japan to be
educated, and come back full of civilisation and
enthusiasms, soon cast off their energy like a slough
and return to the shiftless, slouching habits of
the land where it is “always afternoon.” For
them such habits are natural, and perhaps necessary,
but a worse effect is that white men get like that
too, in time, and though they may work well enough
at the business by which they live, they become
indifferent, shiftless, careless about dress and the
niceties of our civilisation; everything is too much
trouble, and they just jog along in a half-animal
routine. The young ones still fret for the world
they have left, which remains fresh in their
memories; but this life takes hold on men, and
they become so rooted in its ways that they
deteriorate and can never live happily anywhere
else again—in the same way that a mind deteriorates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
on the slip-shod mental fare of magazine-reading,
and cannot be happy with anything that requires
more effort to assimilate. This, then, I find is the
secret of that “nameless” fascination of the Far
East that one hears and reads so much about—it is
the secret of deterioration which is so easy, and
elevation which is so hard, so useless, so unnecessary—let
us lie in a long chair and drink one whisky
peg after the other—who cares what the home
papers say—what rot it is to bother about anything
but poker and shooting, or why old Wing Chang
bought Brown’s pony.</p>

<p>And when you think of the <em>real</em> meaning of
“Ship me somewhere east of Suez”—well, you
can’t think of it till you live there yourself for a
month or two. My refrain is, “Ship me somewhere
west of Suez,” where there is health for body and
soul—the west of the exquisite thrush and the lilac
bush, instead of the empty, gaudy parrot and the
flaming, scentless canna.</p>

<p>Heavens! What a tirade!</p>

<p><em>One</em> woman have I met who likes the Philippines;
though many, as I know, love India, and the
Straits, and Ceylon. But then those are generally
people who go away to “hills” and so on, or take
trips home. Here there are no “hills,” and a trip
home is a serious life-problem. Just so, this one
woman who has been found to like the Philippines
happens to be the wife of a missionary, so, of course,
she goes every hot season for a “nice long holiday”
to Japan.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that you may imagine we
have savages here when I speak of missionaries,
but that is not the case, in this island at any
rate, for these good people are here—oh such a lot
of them!—to convert the Filipinos from Roman
Catholicism. This is really a work of supererogation,
for, though the Spanish priests did ill-treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the Filipinos, the natives are free now from
that terror, and this religion, with its mysteries
and pomp, appeals to them, and suits their dispositions
perfectly.</p>

<p>I am afraid the unbiassed observer would
find the missionaries far more convincing in their
enthusiasm, if it led them to give up the beautiful
houses and comfortable carriages they enjoy
here, their tea-parties, lectures, and so on, and
go and rough it in some of the other islands,
where there are plenty of savages, Mahommedans,
devil-worshippers, cannibals, and all sorts of
unreclaimed sheep.</p>

<p>Before I left home, I remember a very enthusiastic
but woefully ignorant old lady being filled
with excitement when she heard I was going to
the Philippine Islands, and showing me missionary
journals with a great deal written in them about
“the good work” being done out here. At first
I very naturally thought it was the savages who
were being tackled, but—“Oh dear no!” she cried,
quite shocked. “The poor Filipinos are being
saved from the dreadful influence of the Roman
Catholics.”</p>

<p>I said: “But surely they are also the
followers of Christ? Only they do not interpret
His sayings quite as we do ourselves.”</p>

<p>“No, <em>no</em>, they are <em>wicked</em> people! The Filipinos
<em>must</em> be saved! Do, <em>do</em>, when you are out there,
interest yourself in this noble work. I will send
you little books——”</p>

<p>Strange, isn’t it? And of course about the
people, the laws, the climate, she knew less than
nothing, though I am sure the poor old soul
gave many a shilling out of her miserable income
towards the fund that gives the missionary’s well-dressed
wife a “nice little holiday in Japan.”</p>

<p>In these civilised (?) parts of the Philippines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
there is a good deal of religious trouble and dissension
already, without missionary enterprise to
stir it up, as a very determined patriot of the
name of Aglipay has cut himself adrift from the
authority of Rome and started a church called
La Iglesia Filipina Independiente, which title,
I am sure, needs no translating. His followers
are numerous, in fact it is generally believed
that they now out-number the orthodox; and the
whole movement is known to be the outward and
visible sign of inward and hidden fires of Insurrection
and Independence. The <i lang="es">Aglipayanos</i>, as
these independent thinkers are usually styled,
have churches of their own, and processions and
ceremonies almost indistinguishable from those
of the Papists. Do you remember a procession I
described to you when we were in Manila? The
bringing down of the Virgin of Antipolo? I now
learn that that was all to do with this quarrel
amongst the followers of the gentle Christ,
though to which side the Virgin of Antipolo
belonged, and who was to be galvanised into
loyalty by the contemplation of her journey, I
am not quite clear, and do not much care, for
the fate of the little old wooden doll is uninteresting—it
is only the people who are ready to
fly at each other’s throats about it who are
remarkable. What poor “worms that bite and
sting in the dust!”</p>

<span class="smaller">VOYAGE TO MANILA</span></h2>

<p class="right">S.S. “<span class="smcap">Butuan</span>,” <i>March 1, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I am launched, you see, and on my journey to
Manila after all, though I do not feel at all well again
yet; but that is not surprising, as it takes such a
long time to pull round in this climate. It is not
that the climate is so much worse than any other,
as long as you keep well, but as soon as you get ill
you go all to pieces, and the first thing to be done
is to ship you off to Hong Kong or Japan as soon
as possible. The climate of the Philippines is very
much abused, more than it really deserves, I think,
for the chief causes of all illness are anæmia or
liver, both arising more from the dreadful food and
the lack of fresh vegetables, fruit, milk, and good
meat than from the actual climate; though, of
course, the illnesses arising from each bad diet are
aggravated by the heat. The amount of tinned
things the people eat would be trying in any climate,
but out here they must be simply deadly. I have
just been reading a book by a traveller, who
announces that there is nothing the matter with
the Philippine climate at all, because he tore
round the Archipelago in record time, crossing the
islands on foot at astounding speed, and living on
native food—and he was not ill. Naturally, he was
not ill; but then his experience is of little value
to men who have to work for their living, sitting in
offices for eight hours a day on six days of the
week, whose food is the sort of provisions one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
get in the towns, and their houses rooted on ill-drained
mud-flats.</p>

<p>Everyone would like to rush about and live a
free, wild life, and, no doubt, if they did, there
would be fewer illnesses and less human wrecks;
but the trouble is that no one would pay them for
doing it; and men must work out here just the
same as in other climates—in fact they seem to
me to work longer hours and harder than anywhere
I ever saw; and the wonder to me is, not
that they are ill, but that so many of them survive
at all. Undoubtedly the only billets worth having
in the tropics are those of a tea-planter, a British
officer, or a professional traveller.</p>

<p>I am in the regular mail steamer, you see, as I
told you I should be, and we were certainly not
given to understand more than the truth anent her
shortcomings, for she is about the same size and
class as those pestiferous little nightmares which run
between Gibraltar and Ceuta. There is no deck
but a plank or two outside the saloon, the latter a
sort of excrescence on the ship, leaving just room
to squeeze a chair between its sides and the
scuppers. The space in the bows is thickly
occupied by marine wonders covered with tarpaulins.
What these may be, as they are not deck cargo, I
can’t think, but they are evidently important
enough to want all the fresh air in the ship.</p>

<p>Aft, the galley treads upon the heels of the
saloon, its fragrance extending still further, and
the strip of deck outside it is completely blocked by
dirty little tables, where frowzy men of the crew seem
to carry on a perpetual March Hare’s tea-party.</p>

<p>Beyond that, again, a half-clad native is for ever
killing hens, and all in a muddle with a couple of
terribly mangy but very kind dogs nosing about
for snacks.</p>

<p>She is a Spanish steamer, and the officers all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Spaniards, very polite, but unkempt, unshaven, and
dressed in soiled white linen suits with no attempt
at a uniform.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to think that this is the mail
between Manila and the chief town of the Islands,
and I can’t understand how it is that in six years
no American enterprise has stepped in to do something
better. I have asked Americans about this,
but they tell me the question does not affect them,
for they can always get permits to go in their own
transports, and then, besides that, there is nothing
to tempt American capital in so slow and jog-trot a
fashion of making dollars. As we went out of
the river, I tried to see our house in the estuary,
but all the blue-grey houses, and corrugated roofs,
and green trees and palms look so exactly alike
that I found it impossible to distinguish ours from
amongst the jumble.</p>

<p>While I was looking over the side, a Filipino
passenger, a middle-aged man, came up and said
something to me, waving his hand towards the
shore. I daresay he took me for his equal and
meant no harm, but I thought it very cool of him to
speak to me, so I simply drew myself up and said
that I did not “habla Castellano,” whereupon he
shuffled off and has not been seen again.</p>

<p>Luckily the weather was very calm, and is so
still, so I was able to appear at the evening meal,
which came off at six! A deadly hour—when you
have not had time to get up any interest in food
since lunch, and yet if you don’t eat you are starving
before bed-time. The dinner consisted of a
thick meat-and-drink soup, such as one might
imagine Russian convicts yearning for in the depths
of a Siberian winter, but for which it was hardly
possible to return thanks in a stifling cabin in the
tropics. After this nice, comforting brew followed
a procession of eight courses of thick and greasy fried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
lumps or appalling stews, each one more fatal and
more full of garlic and spices than the last. I
thought that even if I had been feeling fresh and
hungry on a winter’s day at home I could hardly
have faced the <i>Butuan</i> <i lang="fr">menu</i>, but, as it was, the
mere sight and smell of the dishes made me almost
hysterical.</p>

<p>The polite little captain pressed me to eat,
and I did not like to hurt his feelings by refusing
what he thought was excellent fare; but I
escaped alive by waiting till his head was turned,
and then dexterously passing lumps down to one
of the kind, mangy dogs until the poor beast was
detected by a <i lang="es">muchacho</i> and kicked, howling, on to
the deck. After that I assured the skipper that I
had had quite enough; an excellent dinner; I
positively could not eat any more. He bowed and
offered me coffee. I took a cup, and with that and
dry biscuit made a tolerable meal.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock I went below, as I felt very
tired, because it was almost my first day out of bed
since my illness. Besides that, even if I had been
in keen and robust health there would have been
nothing to tempt me to remain on the narrow deck,
which was pitch dark, or in the stuffy saloon with a
couple of guttering candles in tall stands on the
table by way of sole illumination.</p>

<p>The accommodation below is of much the same
type as the luxury above, below decks being just of
the build of one of the old penny steamers that used
to go up and down the Thames—you remember
the sort of things—a very low roof supported by
small iron pillars. Off a narrow passage open
seven small cabins, with four berths in each of
them, but they are really not so bad when you get
one all to yourself, and I have the best one, at the
end of the ship. I caught the fat <i lang="es">Mayordomo</i> (chief
steward), and after endless trouble, managed to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a key for my cabin door, though the choice lay
between having it open or dying of asphyxiation;
but I preferred the latter risk of the two, as at
least I could be certain what to expect if I kept it
locked.</p>

<p>One look at the mattresses was enough. I
slept, or rather lay awake sweltering, on all the
coverlets piled on the least filthy of the upper
berths. The cabin smelt horrible, and the only
light there, as in the saloon, was a candle in a
bracket, the glass of which was so grimed with dirt
that it gave hardly any light at all. No water was
laid on to the filthy basin, and it did not do to let
one’s mind dwell for one instant on cockroaches—like
a child who tries not to think of some horrible
ghost story in the dark.</p>

<p>About six this morning the <i lang="es">muchacho</i> (they
have no word for steward apparently) woke me by
rattling at the handle of my door, when I climbed
down and held parley with him through the crack.
He said something in English about “washing,”
and I thinking he had brought me water to put in
the unspeakable basin, said: “No, not yet,” and
tried to shut the door.</p>

<p>However, he was not to be ignored, for he
shoved the door open, apologising as he did so,
came in and shut and fastened down the scuttle, and
then backed out again with many more bows and
excuses. Then I understood that it was not I who
was to be washed, but the decks! Somehow, it
had not occurred to me that the decks of the <i>Butuan</i>
ever could be cleaned like those of other ships!</p>

<p>All day long we have been slipping past these
Dream Islands, sometimes so close that one can
see the waves breaking on the rocks and the blue
sea running up into fairy bays, and I should so
much like to go ashore in some of them, and see
the negritos and savages, and the beautiful jungles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
where monkeys swing about on great flowering
vines. That is always the Tropic Island of one’s
dreams, is it not? But now I begin to think that
possibly life is not all a transformation scene in
the lovely jungles, where there are doubtless
deadly snakes; poisonous, scentless plants; swamps,
and malaria, to say nothing of the fatigues
and difficulties of getting there. On the whole,
for beauty of scenery, health and comfort, I think I
would rather live in a glen on a Scottish moor.</p>

<p>My luggage is rather on my mind, as I found I
had to bring such a quantity, for muslin and cotton
frocks take up so much room that I was compelled
to abandon my first plan of one moderate trunk,
and am now engineering what looks like a family
“flitting.” Talking of frocks, you once asked me
to tell you if those I had brought out were all right.
They are quite right, thanks, at least the muslins
are and the very thin cottons, but anything thicker,
even print, is too warm, and the very thinnest of
stuff skirts or coats are stifling and impossible.
I always envy the lucky women in Hong Kong
whom I left going about in white serge and grey
flannel, and even being compelled to put wraps on
in the evening!</p>

<p>Another thing I find about clothes is that every
one wears white, and though one gets rather tired
of it, still it is the best thing for the fashion of
washing clothes by pounding them on boulders,
and then drying them in this terrific sun will
evaporate the strongest colours in an incredibly
short time. Clothes don’t last long here anyhow,
colour or no colour, as there is something in the
water that rots material, so that it goes into holes
and tears if you look at it, and something in the air
which rots silk even more disastrously and quickly,
and turns all white silk and satin quite deep
yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been writing this at intervals all day, and
now it is six o’clock, and the meal is due. I can
see the polite skipper standing waiting for me to
enter and take my seat, and the mangy dog trying
to squeeze himself in under the bench where my
place is. So I will leave off and finish this in
Manila, where we are to arrive in the early morning.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, <i>March 2</i>.</p>

<p>I thought a mail would be going out the day I
got here, but I find it does not go till to-morrow
morning, of which I am rather glad, as it gives me
time to let you know I have arrived safely. Yet
when you get this—oh what a long way off—the
trip to Manila will be a half-forgotten thing of the
past!</p>

<p>The <i>Butuan</i> (by-the-bye, she has taken that
name from a town in the big southern island of
Mindanao) anchored off the mouth of the Pasig at
three o’clock this morning, and deck-washing began
at four. So at about five I opened my door a little
bit and roared for the <i lang="es">muchacho</i>, till someone else
in another cabin got tired of hearing me, and took
up the cry, and it spread through the ship like the
cock-crowing in the dawn. By-the-bye, I got away
from the shrill of the crickets for a few hours, but
did not, as I had hoped, escape the eternal cock-crowing,
for those fowls on board the <i>Butuan</i> which
had escaped death began to crow at four o’clock for
all they were worth, poor things. Well, at last the
<i lang="es">muchacho</i> came along and brought me a perilous
candle and some hot water, and I dressed and
packed up the few things I had out, and went up
on deck at about six.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>At sunrise—a thick, pink, hazy sunrise—we
steamed up the river, but I was <i lang="fr">blasé</i> about
everything but food, so I stayed in the saloon
and managed to get some biscuits and coffee, and
to avoid a plate full of deadly-looking ham and
eggs.</p>

<p>There was no room to anchor at the quay,
which was fringed with a close line of steamers
berthed stern-first, so she anchored in the stream;
and until I was “fetched,” I amused myself
watching the blue-green water-plants go trailing
past, and trying to observe life on board the big,
covered, brown lighters. No life was to be seen,
however, except the natives wielding immense
punt-poles, who walked along the sides of the
barges on a platform one plank wide.</p>

<p>At about seven the company’s launch came for
me, and she made quite a long trip, down the Pasig
and all along outside the breakwater, as the shorter
way through was blocked by a dredger. A
tremendous new harbour is being built, which bids
fair to be a very fine concern, and the Americans
think a great deal of it, and say it will enable
Manila to compete with and eclipse the shipping of
Hong Kong. This is a difficult piece of reasoning
to follow, for a glance at a map shows how out of
the stream of the world’s traffic Manila lies; and
then, besides that, there are the tariffs and customs,
and all the vexations of the American system of
government, which will make it impossible to
compete with the traffic of a free port like Hong
Kong. Moreover, it will never pay anyone to shift
cargoes in a port where the coolies are so lazy and
labour so expensive as in Manila.</p>

<p>It is the American go-ahead, run-before-you-walk
way, too, to build great docks and harbours
costing millions before they have spent the necessary
thousands in constructing roads to bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
merchandise from inland, or sacrificed the hundreds
required to encourage trade.</p>

<p>The same thing is being done down in Iloilo,
where two millions are being spent on a harbour,
when there is not one tolerable road across the
island, and all the revenues that choke agriculture go
to pay the officials and the school-teachers, conditions
which prevail throughout the Archipelago. The
Americans mean well by the Philippines, that no one
can doubt for an instant, which makes it all the
more sad to see them wasting magnificent energy,
and earning nothing but failure and unpopularity,
by going dead against everything that has ever been
discovered about the successful government of
Asiatics. But then, is this real government? It is
very difficult to know what to call it, as at one
time the venture is referred to as a “Colony,” at
another as “The youngest of the United States,”
and yet again as “A Sacred Trust.” I mean they
use these terms indiscriminately and officially, which
is very puzzling.</p>

<p>But I am wandering away from the trip in the
launch, which went all round these same harbour
works till it came right in front of our friends’
house, where a boat came off and took me through
the shallow water to the steps at the end of the
garden.</p>

<p>It was then nearly eight o’clock, so the day was
getting very hot, and the cool house seemed
delicious. Breakfast—nice, clean, ungreasy breakfast!—and
the joys of a bath. There was a
“bathroom” on the <i>Butuan</i>, but in a state of dirt
that would have made bathing impossible, even if
the bath itself had not been full of old lamps, boots,
tin cans, and dirty clothes.</p>

<p>I have spent all the day resting in the house, to
save up my energies for an entertainment which I
should be very sorry to miss. This is a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
reception to be held by the Governor, Mr Luke E.
Wright, at his palace on the river, where one will
see, as a compatriot informed me, “all Manila at a
glance.” I don’t think a glance will satisfy me
though, for I want to go and have a good long look.
I feel better already for the change of air and scene,
and am sure I shall be quite equal to the reception,
besides, I would rather be ill than miss such a
party!</p>

<p>I say I spent all the day in the house, but that is
not quite accurate, for we went for a drive at sunset
to a library in the town, in a Spanish book-shop;
and on our way back took a turn round the Luneta,
the promenade by the sea, which I fancy I may
have mentioned to you already. The band plays
there every evening, and everyone drives or walks
about. It was a very pretty sight to see the people
in white dresses, all moving about in the radius of
the electric lights on the bandstand, the lights
looking like spots of white fire against the yellow
sunset.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_15">LETTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN OFFICIAL ENTERTAINMENT</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, <i>March 3, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I sent a long letter to you by the mail, which went
out this morning; but I must begin another at once,
as I want to tell you about the reception last night.
Indeed, if I don’t keep a letter always going on
while I am here, I shall not be able to tell you half
what I want to say about Manila.</p>

<p>We dined at half-past seven last night, and then,
with a small party of friends, drove through the
town to a wharf in front of the large Cold-Storage
buildings by the river. Here we had to pass over
some large, flat lighters, on the decks of which the
moonlight revealed myriads of enormous cockroaches
hurrying about in all directions, which
made us catch up our skirts and run for the launch
lying alongside the lighters, and all decorated with
palms and Japanese lanterns.</p>

<p>At the wharf some more friends had joined us,
so we were quite a large party in the bows of the
launch as she steamed up the Pasig, and the cool,
or comparatively cool, night air was delicious. The
river looked quite pretty in the moonlight, and
though it was only a small, rather new moon, the
light was quite strong, and the green of the trees
was quite perceptible, for there is colour in the
moonlight in this part of the world, where the
moon does not make mere black and white outlines,
but you can distinguish colours quite plainly. The
Palace of Malacañan soon came in sight—a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
building blazing with lights, and adorned by rows
of little lamps in festoons all along the water’s edge,
like Earl’s Court Exhibition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus8">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Manila.</span></p>
<p class="caption">Malacañan Palace.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_120"><i>To face page 120.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>We landed at a low stone wall, outlined for the
occasion with red and yellow electric lights. The
launch immediately in front of ours was that of the
Chinese Consul, very profusely and beautifully
decorated, and filled with Celestials in bright silk
dresses. We stepped at once into the gardens,
which come right down to the water’s edge, and
found ourselves in the <i lang="fr">fête</i>—all in full swing, with
crowds of people walking up and down paths
covered with sailcloth to protect the dresses. Of
course everyone was going about in evening dress,
as if in a ball-room at home, and feeling very
hot, and looking for cool places. The idea of this
perpetual heat soon becomes familiar, but sometimes
it strikes the imagination, on occasions of
this kind, with particular insistence. In my letters
to you I can’t go on saying “It is very hot,” “It is
very sultry,” and so on, and yet I know that you
reading them at home, can have no idea of the
<em>setting</em> of all I tell you; of the terrible blazing sun
all day long; the hot nights only bearable by
comparison with the day; of one’s skin always
moist, if it is not actually running in little rivulets,
as in a Turkish bath; of even the dogs and cats
spending all their lives trying to find draughts to
lie in. And this, I am informed, is the “winter.”</p>

<p>Well, this entertainment, which was very well
done indeed, reminded me more and more of Earl’s
Court, as we passed under arcades of coloured
lights, and the Constabulary Band played selections
on a grass lawn under the trees. There was a
huge open-air ball-room, built over some lawn-tennis
courts, raised up and approached by a little
flight of steps, and with seats all round inside a
rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Our first duty was to present ourselves to the
Governor, Mr Luke E. Wright, and his wife, who
stood under a canopy of white silk, on which were
embroidered the Arms of the Philippines. This
coat of arms is a new invention, and this was its
first appearance. It was designed by an American
called Gillard Hunt, and its heraldic description is
very complicated, and would probably convey as
little to you as it does to me. It happened to be on
the front of the programmes as well as on the
canopy, so I had a good look at it, and the gist of
the design is that it is all red and silver and blue,
and the symbols are the Castle of Spain and a sea-lion,
with a background of the stripes of the
American flag. Above is the crest, which takes
the form of the American Eagle, and the inscription
written below is “Philippine Islands.” It makes
a very pretty crest, but it is difficult to understand
why the Philippine shield should be quartered with
the Arms of Spain any more than if the American
flag should have the Lion and the Unicorn in the
corner. In fact the latter device would be far the
more reasonable of the two.</p>

<p>Well, as I say, the Wrights and their party
stood under this white silk canopy, and the aide-de-camp
introduced those whom they did not know
already; whereupon our hosts shook hands,
repeating each guest’s name, and adding “Pleased
to meet you” in kindly American fashion.</p>

<p>This little ceremony, the American introduction,
always appals me, because I never know
what one is supposed to say in answer. I am
afraid I smile helplessly and murmur, “Thank you
so much!” but I am sure that is not the right thing
to do.</p>

<p>Having passed what the Manila papers call
“The Gobernatorial Party,” we proceeded to drift
about the grounds, which were really charmingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
pretty. I met a good many people I knew, and
enjoyed the evening immensely. After a time
I began to feel very tired, and Mr P—— took
me to the ball-room, where he managed to find
places, and we wedged ourselves into the row
of people sitting all round. I did not dance, but
I found quite enough amusement to compensate
me in looking on.</p>

<p>The crowd was pretty mixed, of course, but
“Manila at a glance” included one or two who
looked like gentle-folk, and there were certainly
a great many pretty dresses, which, I am told,
the wearers import from Paris recklessly. Some
of the <i lang="es">camisas</i> worn by the native ladies were
quite lovely—beautiful, delicate fabrics exquisitely
embroidered and hand-painted—and in the Official
Rigodon, with which the ball began, I noticed
how well the wearers moved.</p>

<p>As a contrast, one of the most remarkable
spectacles of the evening was the Gibson Girl, of
whom there were several specimens to be seen
strutting about. All Americans, men and women,
as I have noticed at home and on the Continent,
have something of this type about them, and I
often wonder whether Dana Gibson has discovered
the essentials of the American type, or whether
he has invented a model which they admire and
try to copy. Whichever it is, when it is natural
it is pretty enough in moderation, but some of
them have, as they would express it, “got right
there,” and they may be picked out of any
crowd of ordinary human shapes at a glance.
Of course no human being really could have the
proportions of the Gibson Girl as she is on paper,
for no living thing ever had such length of leg
and neck but a giraffe; only so many Americans
have that type of face, with a low, pretty square
forehead, thick, round nose, heavy jaw, and arched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
eyebrows. Corsets and high hair-pads can help
towards the rest of the design. I can’t think
how anyone wants to be a Gibson Girl, unless
for twenty guineas a week at a theatre, as the
pose and the untidy hair is inexpressibly common
and shop-girlish. Moreover, I don’t see how
anyone can expect to ape anything and avoid
being vulgar. The Gibson Girl does not escape
this latter calamity. She “gets right there just
every time.”</p>

<p>After watching the dancing for a good while,
I was taken round the grounds and given
refreshment at one of the little buffets in the
garden. A most amusing episode occurred at the
chief of these buffets, where a big bowl of punch
was being administered by the Chinese servants,
who opened everything they could lay hands on—whisky,
port, claret, soda, liqueurs, brandy,
champagne—and poured it all into the punch.
You can imagine what ludicrous stories were
afloat about people who had taken one sip of
this fire-water, and were reported to have been
carried off half-dying, and shipped home down
the river.</p>

<p>About half-past ten the crowds began to thin,
and we left the palace, getting upon our launch
again at the same place where we had landed.
There was no more moon, but the stars made
quite a bright light, and the air was so fresh
upon the water at that hour that one could
actually stand the extra warmth of a chiffon scarf
across one’s bare shoulders.</p>

<p class="right"><i>March 4.</i></p>

<p>I found myself very tired yesterday after the
<i lang="fr">fête</i>, so I stayed in the house all day, except for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a drive in the evening to the Escolta, which is
the principal street of shops. When we came
here in November, fresh from palatial Hong Kong,
I thought this town the most shoddy and hideous
place I had ever seen, but now I find it really
difficult to recall my first impressions, for it seems
a gay and handsome metropolis to the provincial
from Iloilo!</p>

<p>At Iloilo our streets consist of ruins hastily
patched up, and great fire-blackened gaps in the
rows of houses, but in Manila, though there has
been apparently just as much hasty patching, there
are comparatively few ruins to be seen, and perhaps
a trifle less string used in the harnesses of the
horses. White women and <i lang="es">Mestizas</i> go about in
hats too, which is a superfluity we do not affect in
the provinces, and after so many weeks of not
wearing a hat, I find it very irksome and hot to have
to put one on. However, in Manila one must
do as Manila does, I suppose, though the fashion,
which did not obtain in the Spanish days, seems a
foolish and unnecessary one, and the people who
were here under the old <i lang="fr">régime</i> rail helplessly
against the innovation. Certainly it is no gain to
the coloured ladies to hide their nice, thick black
hair with the frightful “Parisian” confections which
appeal to their exotic taste; but, of course, it would
never do for them not to follow the fashions set by
their American equals. They have, however, that
strange and subtle way of the Oriental all the
world over, of setting a seal of their own upon even
the most slavish imitations. One feels in this, as
in everything else in Manila, that if the American
influence were withdrawn, in twenty-four hours all
trace of that busy, kind-hearted, bustling, incongruous
people would begin to melt steadily away,
and in a month would be wiped clean out.</p>

<p>There are big, or comparatively big, shops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
with a great display in the windows, and huge
signs, and hurry-up-its-your-only-chance notices,
and conversational advertisements in the American
fashion. But when you get inside the shops there
is the familiar barrenness, and there are the same
half-asleep or half-drugged Filipinos and yellow
<i lang="es">Mestizos</i> yawning and trimming their nails with
the same vague indifference, and nothing to sell
that any human being ever wants. And the prices
of the things you buy, instead of what you wanted,
are enough to make your hair turn snow-white on
the spot.</p>

<p>One fact, striking fact about the shops in this
country is that the largest and most important are
those of the jewellers, and the reason of this is
that the Filipinos and Eurasians have a mistrust of
banks and investments for their spare cash, with
which they buy jewels partly for love of the
glittering ornaments, and partly from some muddled
idea of having their money safe in a portable form.
I was talking about this to a very civil Frenchman
in one of the biggest jeweller’s here this morning,
while I was waiting for a ring they had been
repairing, and he was very interested to hear I had
come from Iloilo, for he told me he had travelled
all about Panay selling jewellery a year or more
ago, and that he knew that island quite well. I
asked him if he had done well there, and he said
yes, very good business indeed; and when I asked
him what sort of things he sold, he showed me
beautiful diamonds set in rather red gold, and said
I would be astonished if I saw the “<em>types</em>” who
could buy such ornaments. He said he rode a
horse, as the roads were only rough tracks with
broken bridges, but I don’t suppose he really did
go all over the island, and fancy he must rather
have gone in coasting steamers and ridden about
the suburbs of the towns, for there are no inland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
towns in the Philippines, and no market, even for
the best diamonds.</p>

<p>Talking of <i lang="es">Mestizos</i> reminds me of an account I
heard, from a friend at the reception, of an
English-<i lang="es">Mestizo</i> wedding, which may amuse you,
and is extraordinarily characteristic of these people.
The bridal party assembled in church in the
orthodox fashion, but the bride’s Filipino and
Eurasian relations, instead of remaining in their
pews, all crowded up to the altar and stood in a
mass amongst the wedding-group and bridesmaids;
and after this astonishing ceremony, the happy
couple marched down the aisle to the strains of
“The Washington Post.”</p>

<span class="smaller">MANILA AND ITS INHABITANTS</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, <i>March 5, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I wrote in the morning yesterday, and after the
heat of the day we drove outside the town to a
nursery garden. To get there we passed through
long streets of untidy suburbs, not of palm-thatch
huts and bamboo groves like those in Iloilo, but
very broad and treeless, with mean, low houses
at intervals, and bits of waste ground strewn
with lean dogs and rubbish. There are not
scavenger pariahs here as in Turkey and the
Near East, and I suppose they could not exist in
such a climate, where the rubbish would be too
putrid even for their savoury taste. There are a
good many hawks about, but they don’t scavenge
either, like the hawks in Egypt; all they seem to do
is to hover over poultry, and every now and then
get away with a young fowl or chicken. When we
were driving round between Molo and Jaro a week
or two ago, near the village of Mindoriao, we heard
a great squawking and a scream, and looked round
in time to see a hawk rise up from near a <i lang="es">nipa</i> hut
with a fair-sized hen in his claws. The people
rushed about the plantation and sang out, and the
hawk staggered once or twice, and nearly fell with
the hen, which was very big and heavy for him;
but he got away at last, and the people were left
gazing after him into the sky, like in the picture of
“Robert with his Red Umbrella” in <cite>Struwwelpeter</cite>.
But the scavenging is, or should be, done by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
half-wild pigs with which the native quarters teem—lean,
rough, black and white animals, generally
very mangy, and with long legs and snouts.</p>

<p class="caption">Showing Electric Tram.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_129"><i>To face page 129.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>A great deal of the way to the nursery we
followed the route of a new electric tram, which is
to be opened in the course of a few weeks, and is
to connect all the suburbs with the main town.
Manila is immensely proud of this tram, which is
such a token of progress that it somehow or other
makes up for the lack of paving and other primary
symbols of civilisation. There is a railway here
too, the only one in the Philippines, which goes
about 150 miles inland to a place called Dugupan.
There is constant talk of railways to be built all
over the islands, the concessions for which are being
granted, of course, to American speculators; but
those who know the islands well say the railways
will not benefit anyone, even the speculators, for
what are wanted besides labourers are roads, just
good traffic roads, kept in good repair. However,
it sounds imposing to talk of so many millions of
dollars to be spent on railways “to open up the
Philippines,” and a great deal of philanthropic
energy is, somehow, inferred.</p>

<p>The entrance to the nursery garden was up a
narrow, sandy lane, where a lot of little, half-clad,
brown children ran out after us and offered small,
tousled bunches of faded flowers. Queer little
souls, these Filipino children, with thin limbs and
fluttering muslin garments.</p>

<p>On each side of the sandy lane was a field
planted with rose bushes; in the garden itself
nothing appeared but rows and rows of flower-pots
containing green plants and ferns—the sort of plants
and ferns one only sees in conservatories at home.
The garden was laid out in formal earthen paths,
bordered with tiles, but the gardener was anything
but formal—a huge, fat, old native with Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
eyes, got up airily in white bathing-drawers and a
muslin <i lang="es">camisa</i>.</p>

<p>We went about, and my friend chose ferns and
plants, some of which were lovely, and I very much
wished I could have taken some home with me to
Iloilo, but for the difficulty of transporting them by
the <i>Butuan</i>. There was a charming old grey stone
well in the garden, with steps leading up to it,
some of them formed of beautiful old blue and
green Chinese tiles, the whole shaded by big,
drooping trees, which made that corner of the
garden quite dark. Overhead, along the greater
part of the paths, was a pergola of orchids, while
all sorts of orchids grew from bundles of what
looked like dried sticks tied to the posts. The
sight of the orchids made me realise once again the
temperature we live in, for I thought of how, on a
summer’s day at home, one would find the outside
air quite cold after an orchid house. It also
occurred to me that it sounds all very fine to think
of orchids in cheapness and profusion, but I have
never yet seen an orchid that could compare as an
object of beauty with a dog-rose out of a hedge.</p>

<p>On the way back we halted to hear some jolly
tunes played by the band on the Luneta. Again
there was the blue dusk; the orange and saffron
horizon; and the moving crowds in white on the
bright green grass plots round the bandstand. We
stayed in the carriage, which moved slowly round
with hundreds of others, all going in the same
direction. I believe the only carriage that has the
privilege of moving the other way is that of the
Governor.</p>

<p>Going in and out of the crowd, everywhere,
were two little American girls, seated astride on a
bare-backed pony, with their hair floating loose
behind, and tied with an immense bow of ribbon on
one side of the forehead in American fashion; their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
thin little legs dangling side by side on each flank
of the pony. They looked very happy and solemn,
and the way they stuck on was simply wonderful.</p>

<p class="caption">The Luneta.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_130"><i>To face page 130.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The Luneta is a pretty sight in the evening,
and even amusing, but I must confess I was very
much disappointed in it, because I have read so
much about Manila in American magazines, in which
the Luneta is described as “an evening assemblage
where all the nations of the world jostle one
another”;—or phrases, more lurid, to that effect;
followed by “word pictures” of Jew and Moor,
Chinaman and Turk, Cingalee, Slav, and Hindu, all
rubbing shoulders in their respective national
costumes. So I looked out for this sight particularly,
but have never seen anything but men of
varying degrees of white and Malay in linen suits,
and women and Gibson Girls in the last scream of
Paris-Manila fashions. I have asked people about
it too, in case I should have been to the Luneta
only on days when the Jews, Moors, etc., were unavoidably
absent; but I only got laughed at for
imagining such nonsense, and when I said, I had
read accounts by American eye-witnesses, my
friends only laughed the more.</p>

<p class="right"><i>March 6.</i></p>

<p>I am afraid I am not seeing as much of Manila as
I had hoped, after all, for I find I am not well
enough to go about a great deal, but what I do see
I try to remember in order to tell you. Having these
letters to write is an amusement in the long, hot
hours in the house, so don’t think that I am giving
up delirious joys to find time to write to you! All
the same, if I did go out more into Manila Society, I
should not have any more to tell you, for there
would be nothing to describe but Bridge. That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the only thing anyone ever does. Manila was
pictured to me as a very gay place, in fact the
Manila papers even go so far as to label it the
“Gayest City of the Orient”; but it is really a
dreadfully dull little town, with a very occasional
dance to enliven the interminable round of dinner
and Bridge parties, and those curious and costly
luncheon parties which American women give to
each other. So much I had already inferred from
the Society Columns of the Manila papers, which
come to us in Iloilo as a breath from the wide
world! When I arrived here and saw the place,
and asked some questions, I found my worst fears
realised, and that far from being the gayest city
of the Orient—think of Cairo, Calcutta, Colombo!—Manila
is probably the dullest spot of the East or
West, and any gaiety or intellect it might have is
choked and strangled by Bridge and Euchre. In
a country like this, where there is little or no
housekeeping and no shopping to fill the minds and
time of the average women, card-playing seems to
attain colossal proportions, for they actually go out
of their houses at eight in the morning to meet and
play cards till lunch (the Americans do not use the
word tiffin), and after a siesta they begin again, go
home to dinner, or out to a dinner party, and
probably play half the night.</p>

<p>The Americans in Iloilo are just as keen,
however, and the first question they ask you is if
you play Bridge; and if you don’t they take no
further interest in you, and never dream of
inviting you to their houses.</p>

<p>The Americans are fearfully down on the Filipino
national game of <i lang="es">Monte</i> about which the
natives are infatuated, and over which they ruin
themselves, but the indignation of the ruling race
carries very little weight, as it is all precept and no
example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>I went for a little drive yesterday evening,
through the old Spanish Intramuros, the Walled
City, within the high old walls, which stand in a
neglected moat, and are all covered with moss and
grass and trailing weeds. The narrow streets are
cobbled, and the quaint houses, with deep, barred
basement windows, have a delightful air of repose,
after the half-finished, skin-deep, hustling modernity
of Americanised Manila. The whole quarter seems
a far more appropriate setting than the rest of the
town for the “mild-eyed lotus eaters,” which the
Filipinos really are by choice, nature, and instinct.
I think that if I lived in Manila (which heaven
forbid should ever be my fate!) I should like to
live in the Walled City—that is, if I survived the
awful smells—and imagine myself in an East where
there were no arc-lights, no electric trams, no
drinking saloons, ice-cream sodas, “Hiawatha,”
or Bridge, and where the natives would be humble,
civil, prosperous, and happy.</p>

<p>There are some fine old gates to the Walled
City, but the Americans whose idiosyncrasy it is not
to reverence antiquity unless it has cost fabulous
sums at Drouot’s or Christie’s, are pulling them
down for no reason at all.</p>

<p>A great many natives bustle about American
Manila in European or white linen suits, and it is
a very exhausting place; but one can’t quite see the
good of it all. I asked an American official (what
they call “a prominent citizen”), whom I met at
dinner the other night, how the Filipinos were to
profit by all this bustle and book-learning.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “I guess they will learn to
appreciate our civilisation and then want it, and
want all the things that civilisation entails, so there
will be a demand, and trade will come right along,
and these islands will wake up <em>and</em> flourish.”</p>

<p>I wanted to argue, however, so I said: “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
why should the Filipinos wake up? Why not give
the poor creatures lots of cheap food. If they have
a little rice, and a banana patch, and a <i lang="es">nipa</i> hut,
and no priests to bother them, that is all they
want, and there will always be an inexhaustible
market for the produce of the islands. It seems
such a pity to daze their poor brains, and hurry
them about like this.” But he said it was no good
trying to talk about this to me, as I evidently could
not understand the American Ideal.</p>

<p>So I dropped the subject, for when it comes to
the American Ideal, I am hopelessly at variance,
and think it better to say no more. The Ideal is
this, you see, that every people in the world should
have self-government and equal rights. This means,
when reduced from windy oratory to common-sense,
that they consider these Malay half-breeds to
be capable, after six years of school-teaching by the
type of master I described to you (about which type,
by-the-bye, experience has given me no reason to
change my mind), of understanding the motives, and
profiting by the institutions which it has taken the
highest white races two or three thousand years to
evolve. They are supposed to be so wonderful,
these flat-faced little chaps, because they have shown
a sudden aptitude for the gramophone and imitation
European clothes, a free and abusive press,
and unlimited talk—endless talk. But it seems to
me that these are the traits one is accustomed to in
the emancipated coloured person all the world over.
In fact, when I come to think of it, America with
this funny little possession of hers is like a mother
with her first child, who has never noticed anyone
else’s children, and thinks her own bantling something
entirely without parallel or precedent; quotes
it as a miracle when it shows the most elementary
symptoms of existence, and tries to bring it up on
some fad of her own because it is so much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
precious and more wonderful than any other child
any one else ever had.</p>

<p class="right"><i>March 7.</i></p>

<p>Yesterday we went to buy prison-made goods
at Bilibid, which is the big jail of Manila, and of
the whole Philippine Islands. When anyone has
committed a serious crime, he is sent up to
Bilibid to eke out the period that has to elapse
before he is carted back to his original island
to be executed. The prison is a mass of half-finished-looking
grey stone buildings, where
prisoners in yellow-striped jerseys, like gigantic
wasps, were going about behind iron railings.</p>

<p>We went into a huge stone hall, where there
were quantities of all sorts of basket-work furniture
on show; a row of carriages, all prison-made; and
at the farther end a white man standing behind
some glass-covered tables containing little objects
for sale. I wanted to get some small souvenirs to
send home, and examined carefully all the little
trifles and curios in black wood, bone, and silver,
with which the cases were filled; but I could not
see anything that was uncommon or characteristic,
or even worth buying at all. All the things looked
to me as if someone had been to Naples or
Colombo, and come back and told the Filipinos
what to make, for here were souvenir teaspoons,
paper knives of black wood, bone hairpins, and so
on, and not one of them of a pattern one has not
seen prepared for the traveller in every city of the
world. I hunted all through the cases, and
amongst the furniture in the hall, but could find
nothing distinctive—everything was well made, but
utterly <em>banal</em>. However, this did not concern me
much, as what I had really come for was ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
furniture, and this I managed to get to my satisfaction,
and a little cheaper than in the Chinamen’s
shops in Iloilo, which is to say exactly double the
prices of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Amongst a great many things stored in a
corresponding hall upstairs were some basket
chairs of an uncommon pattern, with a back like a
huge spreading peacock’s tail; but, though they
were pretty, these chairs did not strike me as
characteristic of a people living in <i lang="es">nipa</i> huts, but
much more like the suggestion of a wandering
admirer of <i lang="fr">l’art nouveau</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the chairs, I noticed some small columns
of hard Filipino woods, intended for flower stands,
but the price asked for them was 10 <i lang="es">pesos</i> (one
guinea) each, which I thought ridiculous for
plain, flat, polished wood. It appeared that they
were derelict from the St Louis Exhibition, or, as
it is called, “Exposition,” and on each was resting,
temporarily, a little figure carved in wood and
painted in bright colours, representing a Filipino
man or woman—the woman in red skirt (not <i lang="es">sarong</i>)
and <i lang="es">camisa</i>, and the men with their shirts outside,
and carrying a fighting cock under one arm. By-the-bye,
there is fierce indignation and terrible
offence taken by the Filipinos about that same
“Exposition,” as the Philippine section was got up
attractively barbarous, with too much of the savage
element, wild-men-of-the-woods in fantastic hovels,
and so forth, to please the educated and high-class
natives and <i lang="es">Mestizos</i>, who want independence, and
think <em>they</em> are more likely to get it than the prehistoric
savage.</p>

<p>On the way out here I met a German who had
been to St Louis, and who told me that the two
chief exhibits were the Boer War and the Philippine
section, and that the latter was nearly all savages
in huts, with fish-<i lang="es">corrals</i> in artificial ponds, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that sort of thing. I remember he was quite
surprised to hear that there was any other town
than Manila, or any civilisation in the Philippines
except the marvellous dawn that rose with the
Stars and Stripes. I believe that was very largely
the impression produced in America, and not quite
ingenuously—that the inhabitants of these islands
were a race of naked cannibals and savages who
were suddenly being transformed into the educated
<i lang="es">Mestizo</i>, who goes to college in America and returns
here to write seditious articles and talk his head
off. Well, whatever the impression desired or produced,
the way it was brought about has caused endless
anger amongst those Islanders who would rather
be thought civilised than picturesque.</p>

<p class="right"><i>March 8.</i></p>

<p>I have been out shopping this morning, going
out at such an unusual hour because heavy rain
had fallen in the night, and the air was fresh
in the morning. It is nice to have a fresh morning,
for the early part of the day here is heavy, and day
dawns thick and foggy. At least, the mornings
are thick and foggy in comparison with the exquisite
clearness of the dawn and early hours of the day
in Iloilo. Talking of that, I am much struck by
the colour of the sky here—all over the Philippines,
I mean, or rather, all over where I have been—for
though it is very blue, it is a whity-blue, a thick
sort of colour, not a bit transparent like the sky of
Southern Europe or North Africa. I can’t quite
describe it, but when one looks up at the zenith
one does not seem to be looking into illimitable
spaces of transparency, and the thick white of the
horizon stretches far upwards.</p>

<p>On this shopping expedition I went to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
some things for the house that I thought I might
be able to get cheaper and better here than in
Iloilo. The principal street of shops is, as I told
you, the Escolta, and the next in importance is
the Calla Rosario, where the shops are kept by
Chinamen and one or two Japanese.</p>

<p>On the way there I saw a steamer on fire,
which was a great sight, but rather alarming.
When the carriage was passing over the bridge
spanning the Pasig, I saw crowds running and
looking down on the river, so I told the coachman
to stop, and stood up and saw a fairly large
coasting steamer drawn out from the other
vessels at the wharf and pulled across the stream,
where it lay in a huge wall of flames like
Brünnhilde in the opera of <cite>Siegfried</cite>. When I
first caught sight of it, there was a complete
steamer, but it burnt up with amazing rapidity,
and as I looked, the machinery suddenly sank
through the hull, the bows and stem rose up
to meet each other, and the whole thing doubled
up and vanished beneath the water. Of course
there was no one left on board, but all the same
it was a gruesome sight, and one I know I shall
think of all the way back to Iloilo in that fearful
little <i>Butuan</i> with its wobbly candlesticks.</p>

<p>In the evening we drove out to pay some
calls, and then took a little turn out beyond
Santa Mesa, which is a big residential suburb
on some low hills inland. The people living
there have told me that the air is appreciably
cooler than down in Manila, and there are far
fewer mosquitoes. The latter alone would be
sufficient reason for living there, as the mosquitoes
here are awful, and always hungry night and
day.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bird’s-Eye View of Inland Suburbs of Manila.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_138"><i>To face page 138.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>We drove a little beyond Santa Mesa (which
is, being translated, The Holy Supper) over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
abominable roads through little scrubby coppices.
At one place we saw a most curious sight of
hundreds of white-clad native people, in the
sunset light, passing along a broad field-path
bordered with trees; and I at first thought we
had come across a religious procession. But
when we got nearer, I saw that it was a crowd
returning from the cock-pit; for every second man
carried a cock under his arm; some sitting
comfortably; some draggled with blood, wounded
and miserable; some limp and dead.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you what a feeling of sickness
came over me, for I thought it one of the most
horrible sights I had ever witnessed; and I was
glad when the procession was out of sight, and
I could no longer see the animal-like, degraded
faces of the men and their miserable, blood-stained,
dying birds.</p>

<p>I suppose the good folk in the towns and little
villages in the U.S.A., the electors who control
Philippine affairs, would rise as one man if a
bull-fight took place in these Islands; but yet a
bull-fight, horrible though it must be, is not so
bad as these cock-fights, for at least the toreadors
and matadors risk their own lives to a certain
extent, and run an equal chance with the animals
they torture; so it cannot help being a more
noble, or less ignoble sport than this sickening
cock-fighting. But so much has cock-fighting
become the national “sport” of the Filipino that,
as I have shown you, he is always represented,
typically, with a fighting cock under his arm.
But the significance of that also, and all its
natural consequences of brutality, gambling, and
cruelty, I suppose, escaped the attention of the
benevolent elector, who visited the “Exposition”
at St Louis.</p>

<p>One thing I can never understand, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
is why people make less fuss about the cruelty
towards an animal in proportion to its size.
This sounds ridiculous at first, but when you
come to think of it, it is absolutely true; for
if horses or tigers were set to fight like these
poor fowls—one fight in one palace!—there
would be a howl all over the civilised world,
would there not?</p>

<p class="right"><i>March 9.</i></p>

<p>We had tea yesterday afternoon at four as
usual, and then drove out to Malacañan for me to
call on Mrs Luke E. Wright. The grounds of the
palace looked even more beautiful by daylight than
they had when lighted up at night, and the house is
very fine, with huge rooms like halls, and floors
polished into brown looking-glass, all crowded with
big pictures, arms, and handsome furniture.</p>

<p>Mrs Wright received us on a big open balcony-terrace
overlooking the river, with a fine view;
and here we sat and had tea and talked. Some
other people came before we left, for it was Mrs
Wright’s At Home day, amongst them one of the
prettiest women I have ever seen, wife of some
young man in the American Diplomatic Service,
a tall, dark girl with an exquisite face, and perfectly
dressed in something very filmy and floating, of
delicate mauves, with a big black hat. Her walk,
her air, her dress, made one suddenly feel how
far away Manila is from all the world one is
accustomed to, and what a small, dull, back-water
of the stream of life this is.</p>

<p>We went on to call on the wife of Commissioner
Worcester, a scientist as well as a politician,
and, as his title implies, one of the Americans
on the Philippine Commission. The Worcesters’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
house was a little higher up the river, and
again we sat on a balcony-terrace, but this one
was all hung with plants and creepers, and overshadowed
by dark green trees, through which could
be seen the blue-green soapy-looking river swirling
past, and the opposite bank with flat fields of emerald
grass and bits of bright blue sky. The rail of the
balcony was bordered with plants in pots, while all
sorts of queer orchids and things grew on the over-hanging
branches. It was like a scene in a play, I
thought, and the shade of the deep trees was delightful,
though they made the balcony rather steamy and
airless. Mrs Worcester showed me some of the
most lovely needlework I ever saw; all this native
embroidery on <i lang="es">piña</i> muslin, of which she is a keen
<i lang="fr">connaisseuse</i> and collector. Some of the pieces
were as fine as the most delicate lace, and one
large shawl, in particular, was a marvel of
embroidery on what I took to be very fine net,
but discovered to be drawn threads!</p>

<p>I have been finding out about prices here, in
case we are sent to Manila later on, and the result
of my investigations is that I pray we may be kept
in the Provinces! Rents are appalling, the equivalent
of our £100 a year being quite a modest rent
for a small unfurnished house, and wages are more
than double what is given in Iloilo. You can’t
get a cook to look at you here for less than 40
<i lang="es">pesos</i> a month, which is £48 a year! Most of the
cooks are Chinese, I believe, as it is considered
rather common to have a native cook, though why
this is I am unable to find out, for the Filipinos
are excellent cooks. But that is just where the
American Ideal of Philippines for the Filipinos
begins to fall through, and I noticed at Malacañan
Palace that all the servants were Chinese, and was
told that they were an institution of Mrs Taft, the
wife of the last Governor, the man who, as I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
you, I think, was <em>the</em> original pro-Filipino. One
hears a good deal about this Governor Taft, who
is now Secretary of War in the U.S.A. He was the
first American Civil Governor of the Philippines, and
seems to have a very strong personality, which he
flung into the pro-Filipino cause for all he was
worth, on which account he has become a sort of
patron saint, rivalling Dr Rizal, with the natives,
who believe he is working tooth and nail in the
U.S.A. for the independence he promised them.</p>

<p>It is as impossible to get a clear idea of Mr
Taft as of any other public personage, for while
some people tell me he is a high-souled, disinterested
philanthropist, who will live up to every word
he has uttered, others vow that he is only an
American politician with a skin-deep catch-vote
policy, and that having got the billet he wanted in
America, he is quite capable of turning imperialist
if it suits his book. What is one to believe?</p>

<p>One thing they all agree in, which is that he
has personal magnetism and a great deal of social
charm, which great gifts have stood him in very
good stead, I have no doubt, with the Filipinos,
and have more to do with his vast popularity with
these Orientals than any vows and protestations;
and, perhaps helped to make up for the <i lang="fr">faux-pas</i>
about the Chinese servants, which still rankles in
the native mind.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_17">LETTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">DEMOCRACY AND SOCIETY IN MANILA</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, <i>March 10, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I am still in Manila, you see, but am going home
to-morrow, so I will write a line to go out by
the next mail, which I should miss if I waited
till I get to Iloilo.</p>

<p>I rambled off so in my last letter that I quite
forgot to tell you about a party we went to at
the house of some very rich <i lang="es">Mestizos</i>; a sort of
reception, with desultory dancing, but in the
afternoon, or rather, the evening hours before
dinner.</p>

<p>When we arrived, at about six, the party was
in full blast; rooms cleared for action, blaze of
electric lights, string band, crowds of pretty frocks,
and grounds all lighted up with arcades of paper
lanterns. This climate lends itself particularly to
such entertainments, with the warm evenings, and
there is not much trouble in the way of preparation,
with big, open houses and polished floors.</p>

<p>Our host was a small man, Filipino altogether,
but his wife, a tall and very pretty Mestiza,
“had fewer annas to the rupee,” and was exquisitely
dressed.</p>

<p>I walked about the pretty rooms and met
many friends, besides recognising many of those
I had seen at the Malacañan <i lang="fr">fête</i>, and saw again
the pretty young woman who had charmed me
so at the palace, when we were calling there.
She looked prettier than ever amongst a crowd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
though they were all very smart, and some of
the American women really well dressed with
nice hats.</p>

<p>This is such a small place, and so few travellers
ever come here that everyone knows everyone
else, which makes parties very pleasant, though
I noticed, again, that the Americans are not
really democratic a bit, and there is a great deal
of social distinction made, and people do not recognise
others whom they really know perfectly well.</p>

<p>The army is just as superior as the soldier set
in any garrison in any kingdom; and if a man is a
merchant, unless his business happens to bring in a
large income, it would be absurd for him or his family
to expect to be asked to the exclusive dinners
and parties at which the administrative, military,
and millionaire set congregate. I don’t think I
am at all keen to be a democrat, even a theoretical
one, for it must be very tiresome to have no real
social position of your own, but to depend on
some one else’s recognition of your claims to a
certain income, an appointment, or who you are
seen with, and what you wear—and then, when
all is said and done, to be the social equal of
your workmen and servants. Not that I suppose
for a moment that anyone is really a democrat,
for I have never yet read or heard of such a
being, and certainly I have never seen one.</p>

<p>I have discussed this subject, in all good
nature, and generally half in fun, with nearly
all the Americans I have met, for it is one that
interests me enormously; and the gist of all they
tell me—or imply, which is better—is that all
Americans are the equals of those above but
not of those below them. If I suggest a social
distinction between <em>any</em> citizen of the United States
and the King of England, the mere idea of such
a proposition makes these democrats go into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
fits of laughter; but when I ask them if they,
personally, would consider it an indignity to be
sent to dine in the King’s kitchen with his
scullions, they generally get quite offended and
can’t see that at all. I think, too, that these
subtleties of democratic etiquette must be even
more distracting to the simple Filipino brain
than they are to persons like myself, for though
the “little brown brother” is now being taught
that all men are equal, he can see without
doubt that a native or <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> with plenty of
money can get the wives of the highest American
officials to visit his house, whereas the poorer
relative is not even recognised.</p>

<p>Emerson told his countrymen the truth once
for all when he said that “humanity loves a lord,”—and
it will have “lords,” and must make “lords,”
and the best-intentioned Americans in the world
will no more make these half-bred Malays equals
of each other, or any one else, than <em>they</em> are of
each other or negroes.</p>

<p>You will laugh at me for my vehemence, I
expect! But you can’t think how aggravating it
is to have a principle for ever forced down your
throat by the good folk who blatantly and utterly
disregard the practice. So the end of my reflections
is that I am quite content to curtsey to a
king—<em>and</em> to make my Filipino servants call me
<i lang="es">señora</i>, and put on a clean <i lang="es">camisa</i> when they come
into my presence.</p>

<p>I have wandered away from the <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> party,
but not so very far in reality, for it is at such
gatherings that such reflections occur to me, along
with speculations about the floor, and the refreshments,
and how much duty that woman paid for
that frock. The refreshments, by-the-bye, were
very well done; and indeed, so was the whole
party, and the charming manners of the host and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hostess did a great deal towards making everything
go off well.</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent a harrowing morning trying
to buy some vests for C——. Perfectly ordinary
white cotton vests, such as the men wear here
under their white linen coats, but more difficult to
track and procure in Manila than so many birds
of paradise. When I told my friends I was going
to get vests, they were amazed and asked me why
I did such an eccentric thing, instead of sending to
Hong Kong for them like everyone else. But I
was rather on my mettle about it, and said I would
get them in Manila in one of the Chinese shops,
for people in Iloilo had done this thing, and why
not I?</p>

<p>At one shop, where I had been told to go, a
weary-looking Chinaman was sitting in a chair at
the shop door, and first I tried Spanish on him, but
with no result, not even a flicker of intelligence on
his face. I might have been talking in Pekin. So
I said, “Do you sell cotton vests?”</p>

<p>“Wests? No. No have got wests.” And he
spoke in a tired, helpless drawl, as if his soul had
been deadened by a life of trying to get “wests.”</p>

<p>But I was not to be put off, as I had been to
six other shops and was getting tired. So I said,
“But I was told you sold vests. I don’t mean
waistcoats,” which I know <em>they</em> often do, “I mean
things to wear under a coat. Vests.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Allitee wests. Mellikan-Filipino
store on Escolta. Oh, yes; me savvy all about
wests.” And he looked beyond me as if he had
been marooned in mid-ocean. I think it was really
opium, which one gets accustomed to in the
Filipinos as well, for sometimes they are simply
maddening when they speak as though in a dream,
staring with dull eyes.</p>

<p>The end of the vest story was that at last I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
tracked what I wanted to a Chinese shop, where
the display in the windows consisted of tin pans,
sausages, bead curtains, picture postcards, and
things like that. After a tour of the Escolta, I had
arrived at this shop by the advice of the coachman,
to whom I managed to explain my wishes by a
lurid pantomime in the middle of the street. When
the coachman at last understood that I wanted to
buy vests, and not to make him take his off, we
went, as I say, to this Chinese shop with the
unpromising window-decorations. When I entered
and asked for vests, everyone brightened up, and a
very yellow old man took an opium pipe out of his
mouth, and said something in guttural words to a
fat youth in the comfortable <i lang="fr">négligé</i> of a pair of
blue cotton trousers and a jade bangle.</p>

<p>This person evidently understood English, for
he waived my Spanish aside and began to talk very
fast in <em>pidgin</em>, which, when you hear the real thing,
and not on the stage at home, is very difficult to
understand. However, he seemed to bring the
word “wests” in pretty often, so I began to feel
hopeful, and made the old man draw a chair up to
the counter for me, and sat down.</p>

<p>Presently, after a fearful lot of talk with several
other fat, yellow youths, and a great deal of hauling
down and putting away again of bales and boxes,
and sharp rebukes from another old Chinaman with
a bead counting-board, who was doing his accounts
in a big book with Indian ink and a paint brush,
the boy who was attending to me came back to
where I sat, and threw down a pile of big, flat
bundles with a triumphant air, exclaiming “Wests!”</p>

<p>No such luck, however, for the bundles contained
coloured furniture cretonnes. So I set to work
to explain again, but it was not so easy as it had
been in the Spanish shops, for no one, as far as I
could see, had on such a thing as a vest, an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
coat being the most they wore above the waist line.
I did not dare to go out and make a demonstration
with the coachman, so I just struggled along with
pantomime and bits of French and German, which
really did just as well as English or Spanish; till
at last a light dawned on a Celestial brain, and they
all said some word in Chinese to each other, and
nodded and grinned and replied: “Allitee, Mississy.
Have got.”</p>

<p>And at last a box was opened, inside which
were really and truly white cotton vests. But the
size was unfortunately intended for very small and
consumptive youths, so I had to begin another long
and troublesome explanation that the person they
were intended for was forty-two inches round the
chest, which was conveyed by calculations and
juggling with a metre tape.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the two old men. “Can catchee
flom Hong Kong. All same steamer. You waitee
two tlee days.”</p>

<p>I said I knew that already, and explained that
I was going to Iloilo to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Velly good,” said one old man. “Mollow can
get. Catchee flom one piecee Chinaman in Manila.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I go to the other Chinaman myself?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Me catchee wests. Mollow can get number
one size west.”</p>

<p>However, while this was going on, a bright idea
had evidently occurred to one of the shop boys,
who had been looking so hard at me that I thought
he was ill; but he suddenly left the shop, going out
of a doorway with big Chinese letters in gold on a
red placard over it, and came back, just as I was
leaving the shop, with the very things I wanted—a
dozen of them in a big cardboard box.</p>

<p>Such, then, is shopping in Manila, and it is only
the replica of how I tried to match embroidery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
cotton in the Spanish shop it had been bought in;
and the other despairing adventure I had when I
went in search of fruit dishes. So I now understand
why everyone said it was absurd of me to think I
could “go shopping” in Manila, and I wished I had
done as everyone else does, and got the things
direct from Hong Kong, and saved all the trouble,
as well as the annoyance of paying double; for,
duty and all, it is cheaper to get things in oneself.</p>

<p>I am glad to be going home to Iloilo, as the
weather is beginning to get pretty hot, and Iloilo is
much cooler than this. Of course in Manila one
has the advantages of the Australian provisions
from the Cold Storage, which means fresh meat,
vegetables, and fruit, besides being able to get any
amount of ice, all of which luxuries are a great aid
towards bearing up in a hot season; but the air
at Iloilo is so much lighter, and the fresh mornings
and evenings down there are wonderful tonics.</p>

<p>As to the social attractions of Manila, they are
no better than those at Iloilo. Bridge! How one
gets to hate the very sound of the name of the
game! And now when I see a group chained
silently round a Bridge table, I can only think of
the Souls tied to their Vices in the Frescoes of Hell
in the Campo Santo at Pisa.</p>

<p>I met at dinner the other night the wife of a
very “prominent citizen,” who was a source of
infinite delight to me in an elaborate defence I drew
out of her by pretending I knew nothing about the
game. I find this is the only safe course, by-the-bye,
as, if you admit any knowledge of Bridge,
you are forced to play whether you like it or
not—or whether you can afford it or not, which is
more important!</p>

<p>This good lady told me that it was quite true
that she and the other American ladies play cards
all day, informing me that every morning she, herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
played Bridge from eight to twelve, either in
her own house or in that of a friend. I said:</p>

<p>“But how about your housekeeping?”</p>

<p>“Why,” she answered, “if you have a good
Chinese cook that don’t amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“But it must be an awful bore,” I said, “in this
climate to put on a dress and a hat and go out in
the hottest part of the day.”</p>

<p>To which she replied that if I would let her
teach me Bridge I should understand why she did
these things. She was very amusing, in her dry,
American way, and made us all laugh very much
at the comical things she said. However, she was
really in earnest about her offer to teach me; but I
said I was very grateful, only I thought I would
rather remain ignorant as long as I could if it
“took” so badly as she described.</p>

<p>I feel much better in health for the change; and
everybody here, both my hosts and others, have
been so kind to me that I am quite sorry to
leave them all. There are several pleasant people
down in Iloilo, but I think a change of society
does one as much good as anything else, don’t
you?</p>

<p>This will go out by the Hong Kong mail
to-morrow, and I will catch the next one by
writing as soon as I get home, and sending the
letter by the <i>Butuan</i> when she returns.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_18">LETTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RETURN VOYAGE AND MY COMPANIONS</span></h2>

<p class="right">S.S. “<span class="smcap">Butuan</span>,” <i>March 12, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I will begin a letter to you now, as I may not have
much time for writing just after I get home. Not
that there is really any fear of my letter to you
coming off second best in any case! You say
how much you like my letters, and what a pleasure
they are to you, but they can’t be half such a treat
as yours are to me. I can’t tell you what it is to
hear all the home news, and about the frosty days,
and the Christmas shops, and the cold, jolly winter,
and all the things one longs for out here with a
longing that is absolutely painful in this everlasting,
sweltering heat.</p>

<p>Talking of heat, I don’t think I told you about
a place above Manila away inland, called Benguet?
It is nick-named the Simla of Manila because it is
a cool region, high up in the mountains, where
there are pine trees, and frost at night, and fireplaces
in the houses. This resort is not much good
to the average person, however, for it is three days’
journey from Manila by rail and road—when the
said road is not swept away, which is its usual
condition—and the trip costs more than to go to
Japan. The governor and the whole administration
move up <i lang="fr">en masse</i> in the hot season, and they
have very nice houses, but there is not much in the
way of accommodation for mere mortals. This is the
only attempt at “hills” in the Philippines, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a great pity, but then there are no roads, and the
places away from the big towns are not at all safe.
Even round about Manila the country is infested
with what are officially called <i lang="es">Ladrones</i> (robbers),
who are really Insurgents, and quite recently the
wife of a Filipino official was kidnapped, and there
was a great fuss about it.</p>

<p>The <i>Butuan</i> is, on this trip, even less of a
floating paradise than when I came in her, for, on
arriving on board yesterday, I found to my horror
that she was simply swarming with a Filipino boys’
school going on an Easter outing to Iloilo. I
wonder if you can even faintly imagine what that
means, or even dimly picture the condition of the
ship, when I tell you that there are seven four-berth
cabins and we carry seventy-two first-class
passengers!</p>

<p>I consider myself fortunate in being in the best
cabin again, with nothing worse to put up with than
the company of a pleasant native and her little
maidservant. She, the mistress, is a full-blooded
Filipina, and fearfully indignant at any insinuations
to the contrary; a fat, swarthy person, with a
good-tempered, flat face that is probably handsome
according to its standards, and she wears a
costume reduced to the last limits of propriety,
in the form of an untidy skirt, a spotlessly white
loose linen jacket, and slippers—which, I must say,
is a most enviable get-up in this temperature.</p>

<p>She tells me she was first married to a
Spaniard, who left her very well off, and her
present husband is a German-American in the
coastguard service in Manila. She is now on
a visit to her brother in the Island of Negros. I
took this person to be about thirty; but she tells
me she is forty-three, and that her good temper has
kept her young looking, which I can quite believe,
for she takes the most “unpleasant episodes” with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the greatest amiability, and is really quite a charming
companion. She says that her husband is of a
worrying nature, so he looks forty——</p>

<p>“Which is a very good thing,” she says, laughing
all over her jolly fat brown face, “as he is
only twenty-eight. Did you see him when we
left Manila? He came to see me off.”</p>

<p>But unfortunately I had missed this individual
amongst the seething crowds that pushed about
the deck till we started, and were then bundled
over the side and down a plank like so many
sheep. I can’t think why on earth none of these
places have a gangway for the steamers.</p>

<p>She has told me endless “yarns” about the
Philippines and the Filipinos, the chief points
of interest being emphasised by a bang of her
fan on my knee, which conveys anything to me
from her views on the Papal Supremacy to her
opinion about the sanitation of this ship, the latter
subject taxing even her powers of pantomime.</p>

<p>We have so far had the marvellous luck of
coolness, a clouded sky, and wind. The wind,
however, is a mixed boon, for it means waves—waves
which would hardly count on the Round
Pond, but make the <i>Butuan</i> roll heavily, and
prove too much for the Filipino boys and youths,
who are thick on the ship as swarming bees.
They must be thankful to get rid—on the deck,
by-the-bye—of the fearful, greasy meals which
they stow away with horrible greediness. Knowing
that the Filipinos eat lightly and sparingly, I
remarked to my cabin mate, who came to
sit next me at table, about the diet of these
young countrymen of hers. She, herself, like
the other native passengers, only eats very little—some
chicken and a few vegetables, rice, and
fruit. The gesture she made as she looked at
the schoolboys was most expressive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Babuis!</i>” she said, which is Visayan for pigs,
and as bad as calling a Frenchman <i lang="fr">cochon</i>. “<i>Babuis!</i>
These Government Schools are ruining my people.
I thank God that I have no son who will be taught
to be insolent and unclean, and to eat like that.”</p>

<p>I asked her what she meant by “unclean,”
and she said that the Filipinos wash a great deal,
which I knew already, and are very careful in
certain small details of cleanliness and sanitation,
but that all the new schoolboys were little better
than animals.</p>

<p>Opposite us at table sits a very good-looking
American officer in khaki uniform, who is
evidently not a keen advocate of equality, as he
does not open his lips except to the captain, and
even omits the little bow which the other
passengers make on taking their seats at table.
Moreover, he does not pass things, which is not
a pretty example to the very polite Filipinos and
<i lang="es">Mestizos</i> at the table. All the Filipinos I have
ever seen have those beautiful gracious Spanish
manners which may mean nothing beyond mere
politeness, but they do help to grease the wheels
of life a great deal. The contrast to the older
people of these horrible, noisy, ill-bred young
“yahoos” is heartrending,—the first-fruit of the
American ideal, dressed in appalling variations
on the European costume; cheeky, gluttonous,
self-important—just what one would expect of
a mongrel Malay who is told he is the social
equal of white women.</p>

<p>As I write this to you I am sitting on the
narrow deck, trying to get as far away as I can
from the schoolboy crowd, whose portion of the
deck is unspeakable, apart from the fact that they
think I am an American, and spit on my chair
whenever they get a chance of approaching within
range of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of my chair (I brought my own with
me) sits my cabin mate, looking at a lot of
illustrated English papers which I have with me;
and I am afraid my letter must read very disjointedly,
as I am constantly leaving off to answer
some of her endless and very intelligent questions.</p>

<p>Near us are camped a Spanish <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> and his
fat little wife, who wears a great deal of sham
jewellery and a cotton dressing-gown—a very
superior person, with no pretence at veiling her
scorn of my Filipino friend, nor of me for talking
to her.</p>

<p>The Filipina laughs very good-naturedly, and
says the <i lang="es">Mestizas</i> think themselves very great
<i lang="es">señoras</i>, but she herself does not find their snubs
humiliating, “For,” she says, “I behave as I should,
and we all come from <i lang="es">el buen Dios</i>.”</p>

<p>She is great on <i lang="es">el buen Dios</i>, and one of the
first of her innumerable questions was to ask about
my religion. When I said I was a Protestant, she
hastened, politely, to assure me that she was very
broad-minded on the subjects of heretics, and
refused to believe that they were all devils.</p>

<p>I remarked that I thought we were not much
worse than anyone else.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, “I quite think you are no
worse. Once we had a young man to board in our
house, who was in my husband’s business, and he
was a Protestant. The <i lang="es">padre</i> used to come to me
very often and tell me the young man was a devil,
and that I must send him away. But I would not
do so, for I am broad-minded, and I said he seemed
as good as anyone else, and, though he was a good
man, <i lang="es">el buen Dios</i> had made him a heretic for His
own good reasons.”</p>

<p>I complimented her upon her breadth of view,
and asked her if she were an Aglipayano, but at this
she very indignantly declared she thought it very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
wicked to side against the Holy Father, and one
would surely be punished for such heresy. “They
are worse than the heretics,” she declared, “and
besides that, they are all <i lang="es">Insurrectos</i>.”</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “if you don’t sympathise with
the <i lang="es">Insurrectos</i>, then you like the Americans?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I hate them,” and she made
an ugly grimace.</p>

<p>I asked her why.</p>

<p>She got quite excited, and exclaimed, “Why?
Why, what are they doing here? Who asked them
to govern the Philippines? Who wants them?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, “but they are a very civilised
people, and are going to do you such a lot
of good.”</p>

<p>She simply laughed, and pointed with her fan at
the schoolboys in the bows.</p>

<p>After a little while she said, “<i lang="es">Paciencia!</i> In a
little time they will go. I hear all my people
saying that the Americans will go.”</p>

<p>“You want to govern yourselves, then?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t think we shall be able to.
Some other nation will come and take the islands
when we are left alone. The Japanese, many say;
but we do not want the Japanese.”</p>

<p>On the whole she has made the voyage much
more pleasant for me, for she interests me so much
to talk to, and though it is uncomfortable to be at
such close quarters in the cabin, nothing could
exceed her kindness and good breeding, while the
little maidservant is attentiveness itself.</p>

<p>At night I wanted to have the door open, but
they were both very frightened, and implored me
to shut it and lock it as well, which I readily
consented to, as they were so timid, and I thought
it a shame to make them uneasy, though I felt
quite brave now I was no longer alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>I daresay you are surprised at my accounts of
these and other conversations in Spanish, but the
fact is, though I have not tried to learn the <i lang="fr">patois</i>
that obtains in the Philippines, I find it impossible
not to pick up a good deal, partly from knowing
Italian, I suppose, and partly from having to talk
it occasionally in spite of myself. They speak
badly, though, and the accent does not sound a bit
like what one heard in Spain, besides which, there
are so many native and Chinese words in current
use. Instead of saying <i lang="es">andado</i>, they say <i lang="es">andao</i>;
<i lang="es">pasao</i> for <i lang="es">pasado</i>; and so on, with all the past
participles, besides other variations on the pure
Castilian tongue. I found that the Spanish
grammars and books I had brought with me were
of so little use for everyday life that I gave up
trying to learn out of them, and just get along on
what I pick up—though I am very shy of it, and
would not for the world let any other English
person hear me trying to talk! The native
language is a queer, guggling noise; when written
it looks all g’s and b’s and m’s, and full of uncouth
combinations of hard consonants. Some of the
names of places are native, but many are Spanish,
and the Filipinos themselves all have fine, rolling
Spanish Christian and surnames, which were dealt
out to them indiscriminately by the priests.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>14th</i>.</p>

<p>Now I am home again, you see, and delighted
to be back in my own house, though I had a very
good time while I was away. The <i>Butuan</i> got in
at four yesterday morning, anchoring off the mouth
of the river, and deck-washing set in at once—never
was it more needed!</p>

<p>Oh, the scenes, the sights, the noises on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
foul steamer! At the best of times she is dirty and
uncomfortable, but no words of mine can convey
her unspeakable condition with those awful
Filipino boys on board—at least, no words that can
be set down on paper.</p>

<p>The air of the morning was fresh, when we
dropped anchor off the mouth of the river, and a
nice cold breeze blew from the shore, which at first
only showed as a black line in the dark, with one
or two points of light where the town lay.
Gradually it became more and more distinct in the
dawn, till we saw the outline of the corrugated
roofs, the palm trees, and the shipping on the river,
while a faint, steady crowing of cocks could be
heard.</p>

<p>Have I told you about the cock-crowing? It is
one of the features of Philippine life, and one of the
things you must get accustomed to, or lie down and
die. It begins before daylight, and goes on till
after the sun has set—the screaming of innumerable
cocks, for every living Filipino keeps one, and most
have two or three.</p>

<p>We got a candle, and I dressed first and went on
deck, where I was eventually joined by a tremendous
swell in a trailing silk skirt, French blouse with lace
yoke, long gold chain, white canvas shoes, and so on,
whom I just managed to recognise as my cabin mate.</p>

<p>While we leaned over the rail waiting for the
<i lang="es">Sanidad</i> (the port doctor’s launch), she told me she
thought she should be able to get away that afternoon
for Negros, but she hoped she should see me
again, and said I must be sure to come and pay her
a visit if I went to Manila again. To which end
she proceeded to write down her address on a
crumpled bit of paper which she pulled out of her
pocket, handing me half of it to write mine on. I
saw my piece had writing on it, and I said: “But is
this not something you want to keep?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” she said, “it is only a note of my home
accounts for last month.”</p>

<p>I looked at the accounts and saw the first item
was: “To the <i lang="es">padre</i>—for a mass—two <i lang="es">pesos</i>;”
then some vegetables and meat, and more <i lang="es">padre</i>;
then cigarettes, and again <i lang="es">padre</i>, and lower down,
yet again <i lang="es">padre</i>.</p>

<p>“You seem to pay a lot to the <i lang="es">padre</i>,” I said.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she answered, “for my mother’s soul.”
(<i lang="es">Por el alma di mi madre.</i>) “One must get to
heaven.”</p>

<p>“But the missionaries tell you that you need not
pay money to go to heaven.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she said. “But with them one is
certain to get to hell.”</p>

<p>If my cabin mate was a swell, she was completely
eclipsed by the brilliant appearance of the fat little
<i lang="es">Mestiza</i>, who came up on deck and leaned over the
rail not far from us with a really heroic effort to
appear unconscious of her gorgeous clothes. Her
husband was very waxed about the moustache, and
thin and pointed about the boots, and he kept
shifting his sombrero with a fat hand, which displayed
one very long little finger nail and a huge diamond
ring. The Filipino schoolboys were got up in all
sorts of suits, some in tweeds, some in linen, and
one in bright blue striped silk, which had shrunk a
good deal, and a straw hat with the brim made in a
pattern like an ornamental cane chair-back. The
little chaps were showing each other their clothes,
and the older boys, of fifteen and sixteen (or that
was the age they looked), were fearfully busy and
important, smoking cigarettes, giving orders, and
switching their legs with little walking sticks.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>About six o’clock the <i lang="es">Sanidad</i> came and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
us <i lang="fr">pratique</i>, though I think if he had come before
the deck-washing he must have put us all in
quarantine for the plague. Apparently, too, there
was no objection raised to the number of
passengers in proportion to the accommodation, so
we got ashore. Long before this the company’s
launch had come fussing down the river and out
to the <i>Butuan</i>, with C—— standing in the bows;
and as soon as the doctor’s tour was over, I was
conducted across the <i lang="es">Sanidad</i> launch into the other,
and we went straight to the wharf, and home in a
<i lang="es">quilez</i>, leaving my luggage for the shipping agent
to tackle.</p>

<p>When I arrived at our house, old Tuyay flung
herself down the staircase into the road with
screams and yells of joy, wagging not only her tail
but her whole body; and when I got into the hall
there was the cat from downstairs squeaking, and
telling me some long story about all she had
noticed while I was away, and following me from
room to room.</p>

<p>This cat has established herself with us for the
last few weeks, and now thinks it her right, not to
say her duty, to smell everything that comes into
the house. She was fearfully agitated about the
furniture I brought from Manila, and while it was
being rigged up, and other things shifted, and so on,
the poor pussy went nearly wild with excitement
and curiosity, to say nothing of laying herself out to
be tumbled over and half killed.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_19">LETTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">A <i lang="es">BAILE</i>—A NEW COOK AND AMERICAN METHODS</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>March 20, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I am sure you will be glad to hear that I feel
much better for my Manila trip, and able to go for
our evening walks again, which we still enjoy very
much, though the season is getting rather hot for
moving about with much comfort.</p>

<p>While I was away, there was an outburst of
Carnival gaiety, and C—— went to a ball at the
Spanish Club, which seems to have been a very
good one. It was fancy dress, many of the
costumes were beautiful, and there was a big
supper laid out at little tables in the open air, with
decorations and paper lanterns. They danced till
five in the morning, when the more enduring and
merry spirits drove round the town in open
carriages; so they seem to have had a very gay
time, and I was rather sorry I had missed it, as a
fancy dress ball in Iloilo must be a rare and
precious experience.</p>

<p>So Lent has begun, but apparently it is not
going to be made too strict, for last night we were
bidden to an amateur theatrical performance at
the Santa Cecilia (the Filipino) Club, which was
a very festive affair. The big room of the Santa
Cecilia, which is upstairs, like the Spanish one,
but with a stage at one end, was very gay with
festoons of pink and white muslin, and chains made
of little hoops covered with tinsel paper. Nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the whole audience consisted of Filipino women, in
skirts of screaming reds, blues, greens, and yellows,
set off by bewildering <i lang="es">camisas</i>, their black glossy
hair adorned with many combs, and everywhere
whiffs of penetrating cheap scent.</p>

<p>The hall is so large that the two or three
hundred people present did not nearly fill it,
though little groups of men hung about the side
that opened, with spaces between columns, on to
the staircase and outer hall.</p>

<p>We sat for a long time past the normal hour
for beginning, staring at the drop-scene, which
displayed a large picture of Saint Cecilia playing
on a piano, and looking up to heaven; and had
plenty of time to take in the paintings all round
the room of Magellan, Rizal, Washington, and
other heroes, which were stuck high up in frames,
or frescoed on each side of the stage, while the
band gave us waltzes, Sousa, and “Hiawatha.”
This latter tune seems to have become a sort of
Filipino National Anthem, for no entertainment
of any sort can come off without it, and even a
<i lang="es">banda de musica</i>, playing in the street in the evening,
won’t go away, even after they had received money,
before they have gone through “Hiawatha.” I
don’t think I ever described to you a launch party
we went one evening, on the occasion of a
<i lang="es">despedida</i> (farewell), to a departing American
official? We were a large party, English and
Americans mixed, and filled up the bows of a
fair-sized launch, while abaft the engines a Filipino
string band clung on and played as best they
could as the launch rolled about in a choppy little
sea off Guimaras. As we left the <i lang="es">Muelle</i> (the
quay) these musicians struck up “Hiawatha,” and
when they had got through it they began again, and
again, and again—and I have no doubt they would
have played that air contentedly the whole way out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and back, and probably fully intended to do so, if they
had not been implored to stop. It is not a bad
tune, though, and went remarkably well with the
clicking of the launch’s machinery and the motion
of the waves.</p>

<p>But, to get back to this theatrical performance—though
I don’t think there is much to say about
it, for it was a very ordinary amateur show, and
except that the skins of the performers were
naturally darkened and not artificially white, and
the language they spoke was Spanish, it was indistinguishable
from the same sort of thing at a
charity bazaar at home. Not musical, like the
performance I told you about at the theatre, but
a playlet of a strangely exotic type that must have
been rather unintelligible to most of the brown
brothers and sisters, for it was a sort of French farce
about a man and his wife living in a flat below
another couple, with the usual complications that
apparently inevitably result from such a dangerous
experiment in Paris. One man acted well, and was
now and then really funny; but the humour was <em>not</em>
the most refined fooling I have ever heard, as
you may judge when I tell you that the chief
source of jokes was that one of the husbands was
represented as insinuating himself into the other
household by pretending to be a doctor, and there
was no bowdlerising of his interviews with his lady
patients. The few things he left unsaid were
reserved for another character, who came in as
a house-agent with the most extraordinary fund
of questions imaginable. But the entertainment
hit the popular taste, evidently, for the more
broad the remarks, with no attempt at wit, the
more the “little brown sisters” laughed, in true
Oriental manner.</p>

<p>I got very bored and tired, but did not like to
go out till the first playlet was finished, for fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hurting our hosts’ feelings. We afterwards heard
from a friend that when the second piece was over,
the floor was cleared for a <i lang="es">baile</i>, which was kept up
till quite the early hours of the morning. In the
middle of this dance, however, “a strange thing
happened,” as a certain number of the hosts
suddenly appeared with little plates to collect
money for the expenses of the production. This
manœuvre, as our friend expressed it to us,
“knocked many of the guests completely out of
time,” for the average person does not take much
money to a dance. Some wrote little <i lang="es">vales</i>; but
our friend was rather sharp, for when a girl held
out a plate to him, he bowed very politely and took
it from her, saying, “Pray let me help you,” and so
became a collector instead of a contributor.</p>

<p>We went a new walk through the town a few
evenings ago, on a lovely night, when the grey
streets were all black and white in the moonlight,
but the shadows quite luminous and the sky a real
blue, dark and velvety. We strolled down one or
two streets and through a group of native huts by
the shore; but that part of the shore is some way
from here, as, you see, we were walking across the
spit of land formed by the estuary and the open sea.</p>

<p>In our walk we came to a walled-in graveyard,
with an open grille in the great doorway, through
which one could see a little chapel and green trees,
looking very dark green in the moonlight. On the
opposite side, across the rough, sandy road, was a
high, broken wall of concrete, with a big iron gate,
and apparently nothing but the sea beyond it. We
wondered what the gate could lead to, and thought
there must be some garden on the shore; but when
we went up the one or two crumbling steps, we
found ourselves at once on the beach, and at our
feet a quantity of ruined graves, some half-opened,
some newly-covered, all jumbled up in the moonlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and strewn with rank grass, sand, and
pebbles. It seemed so weird and uncanny, the
great, strong wall shutting in nothing; and the tall
gates leading to nothing; and we afterwards
learnt that this was the Chinese graveyard, which is
always being destroyed by storms, and the wall had
suffered in the bombardment. I don’t suppose the
Chinese use it much, as they always get their bodies
sent back to China if they can, in huge, gaily-painted
coffins, for burial in their native soil.</p>

<p>I forget if I told you about the trouble we have
been having with our cook—the voluble person I
described to you when he was new and interesting.
Now I know that type of Filipino so well! As
time went on the cook’s easy flow of talk became
less interesting, especially as it took the place of
cooking, and I got tired of always telling him to do
his best, for he was one of those half-clever people
who always do things just not as well as they could
do them. Whenever I reproved him, too, I found
a stranger in the kitchen next day, who told me
that he had been sent to take the place of my cook,
who was ill “with his leg.”</p>

<p>Always his leg. Though no human ingenuity
could find out what he was supposed to have the
matter with his leg. I was inclined to think it was a
“sulk leg,” but C—— observed darkly that he had
heard before of fellows getting “drink legs.” On
these occasions the cook’s wife was generally to be
found—a pleasant-faced little woman, in a bright,
clean dress, and wearing long, gold earrings—squatting
on her heels, outside the hall-door,
smoking a huge cigar. The moment I appeared she
always repeated the information about the leg, with
apologies, and vanished.</p>

<p>When the cook had recovered from his indisposition,
he would take up his place in the kitchen,
affable and fluent as ever, and no remarks would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
made by anybody, for I put up with him as long as
I could on account of his generally being sober—a
rare and precious virtue. At last, however, when I
was ill he surpassed himself in crime, sending in
uneatable food to poor neglected C——, and giving
me the same soup and rissoles every day, twice a
day, for a fortnight, till I could not even bear the
smell of them.</p>

<p>When C—— remonstrated, the cook instantly
became impudent, and as impudence is where C——
draws the forbearing line with Filipinos, he gave
the cook one good kick that sent him sprawling out
on to the Azotea. C—— observed that if the cook
summoned him for assault, he would half kill him
next time, but our friend did not resort to Law.
He gathered himself up and went off, and was no
more seen again, though he sent the usual stop-gap
to do his work next day. However, we had no
intention of letting him farm our kitchen, so we
asked the stop-gap, who was an excellent cook, if
he would like to stay on permanently, and he said
he would, and there he is “to this very day,” as
they say in books.</p>

<p>The change has made a great difference in my
housekeeping, both socially and materially. By
socially I mean that I now have a quiet, silent,
intelligent man to deal with instead of a chattering,
cunning monkey; and by materially, that this man
caters for us infinitely better for a <i lang="es">peso</i>, including
firewood, than the other gem did for a <i lang="es">peso</i> and a
half a day. He is willing to learn—real learning, not
jabbering “<i lang="es">mi sabe, mi sabe</i>,” and then sending in
the things all wrong—so I have got out my
English cookery-book and explained many of our
ways of preparing various foods, which he has
grasped with intelligence and admirable results.</p>

<p>We are in great tribulation about ice, as a
deadlock has occurred by which we are without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in this hot season—a most serious and horrible
discomfort. From the beginning we, like everyone
else, got our daily ten pounds of ice from the
Government factory—the military supply—which
came round every morning in the cart driven by the
Stage Cowboy whom I think I described to you.
When this cart pulled up and the handsome driver
sang out “Hielo” (Ice!), servants flew out from all
the houses and presented a ticket, each man secured
his nice cold lump and rushed upstairs again to put
it in the ice-chest.</p>

<p>But a month or more ago an American with a
“pull” (political influence) got the municipal
contract to supply this town with ice, to be worked
in connection with the electric lighting of the streets,
also placed in his control, on which the Government
withdrew their supply so as not to interfere with
private enterprise.</p>

<p>So far, so good. But the “’cute” financier had
got an old electric plant, which works so badly that
the arc-lights are extinguished and the streets are
pitch dark at night. The ice has given out
altogether. The financier, still being paid out of
the rates, has gone off to Manila, and there is no
redress anywhere, for he has a relative high up in
office, is received everywhere, and—in fact he has
a “pull.”</p>

<p>The Government won’t renew their supply of ice
except to the Americans and the clubs. A few
other people who have influence have managed to
get a lump now and then, but for the greater part
we struggle on, at 90° in the shade, with tepid
water to drink, food decaying before the evening,
and butter—even tinned train-oil butter—a thing of
the past.</p>

<p>Such a state of affairs is not so astounding out
here, however, as it may sound to you, for though
you may have heard of the corruption of American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
political life, it does not strike one with such
force when read in papers as when it comes home
to you in daily life like this.</p>

<p>Even out here there seems to be no sense of
that <i lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>, which alone can keep the
ruling race upright before the eyes of the “little
brown brother,” for one cannot take up a Manila
paper without seeing the case of some Provincial
Treasurer, or someone tried for official swindling.</p>

<p>Each town or district is controlled by a
<i lang="es">Presidente</i>, a Filipino, something like a mayor, who,
in his turn, is under the guidance of an American,
called a Provincial Treasurer. Far from being an
example of integrity, the Provincial Treasurer
is very often anything but proof against the
temptations that beset him financially. It is not
hearsay; there are the actual police reports in the
papers. And if those found out and brought
to justice are so many, one can only speculate
in amazement upon the numbers who escape, or
are sheltered by influence or a “pull.”</p>

<p>It does seem such a pity that a great and
noble nation should not be better represented
in the eyes of another—and, when all is said
and done—an inferior race.</p>

<span class="smaller">FILIPINO INDOLENCE—A DROUGHT</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>March 31, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your letter of February 23rd.
We were greatly interested in your description of
the radium baths, though it seems difficult, out
here, to imagine that there is anyone anywhere
taking so much trouble to get hot! I must say,
though, that I don’t feel this heat quite so
much as one might imagine, at least, as far as
actually feeling hot goes. For an evening or
two ago I was quite surprised, when we were
in Hoskyn’s stores, to notice that the thermometer
was marking 92° Fahrenheit. Of course that
was in the cool of the evening, but I had not
noticed any particular heat during the day. I
thought how much it would interest you to get
some idea of the temperature we live in, so we
bought a thermometer and have hung it up in
the <i lang="es">sala</i>. In a way, I am sorry we have done
this, as we did not know before how hot we
really were, and did not mind the heat half so
much.</p>

<p>A watering-cart has begun operations, and as
I write, it is passing down the street. It is a
most amusing contrivance, consisting of a <i lang="es">carabao</i>
waggon with a cask laid longways on it, and a
native sitting astride the <i lang="es">carabao</i>, guiding with
a goad and one string. The water flows out
of a bamboo pole at the back of the barrel, and
a spray is produced by means of a circle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
holes, through which the water squirts uncertainly.
The only result, as far as the roads are concerned,
is a long narrow puddle and a great waste of
precious water, though I expect it is sea water
they use. The whole contrivance is so amusingly
extravagant, shiftless, inefficient—so characteristically
Filipino!</p>

<p><i lang="fr">À propos</i> of the ways of the natives, a Spanish
friend of C——’s, who was here the other day,
told us a long and harrowing story, which was
to him somewhat of a tragedy, though to me, I
am afraid, it was only a source of amusement. This
man tried the venture of keeping a small stable
of <i lang="es">quilezes</i> for hire, which is a favourite speculation
with young men who want to play with a little
capital, either with the idea of trying to keep
body and soul together in this expensive country,
or else with the perennial hope of being able
to get away from it. One of the Englishmen
professes to have made a good thing out of
it (<i lang="es">quilez</i>-hiring), but when we told our Spanish
friend this hopeful news, he refused to be
comforted, and hunched up his shoulders and
spread out his hands, saying, “Horses are cheap
enough, and fares are high, which is very well
from our point of view; but you have the eternal
Filipino to deal with.”</p>

<p>“What does he do in this case?” we asked.</p>

<p>“He does nothing,” said the Spaniard. “In this,
as in every other employment, he does not think
it necessary to learn, or to know anything at all.”</p>

<p>We said we had observed this trait, and that
anyone seemed to be confident in signing on for
any job, anyhow.</p>

<p>“They do,” he said, “and this is the sort
of conversation I have with every man who
represents himself as a driver. ‘Where were
you <i lang="es">cochero</i> before?’ I ask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘With <i lang="es">señor</i> L—— at B——.’</p>

<p>“‘How long ago was that?’</p>

<p>“‘Five years ago.’</p>

<p>“‘Where were you <i lang="es">cochero</i> after that?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I was not <i lang="es">cochero</i>. I was cook to <i lang="es">señor</i>
S——.’</p>

<p>“‘And then?’</p>

<p>“‘Then as <i lang="es">muchacho</i> with <i lang="es">señor</i> C——, and then
as cook——’</p>

<p>“‘And you are a cook, not a <i lang="es">cochero</i>!’</p>

<p>“‘Oh no. <i lang="es">Mi trabajo</i> (my job) is really a <i lang="es">cochero</i>,
but I went as cook to <i lang="es">señor</i> L——, and as <i lang="es">muchacho</i>
to <i lang="es">señor</i> C——, and as——’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, yes. I heard what you said.’</p>

<p>“Then, as this is as good a man as you may hope
to get, you engage him, and it is a great piece of
luck if you get half your fares, and the pony not
killed.”</p>

<p>This story, and many others I have heard to
the same effect, account, in some measure, for the
marvellous and eccentric driving one sees going on—one
can hardly call it “driving,” though, it is
simply a rough and tumble with destiny, and there
are more street accidents in Iloilo in any given
number of hours than in the same time in the whole
of London.</p>

<p>It is so Filipino to be content with make-shifts—the
same thing, the same lazy Malay, and Spanish
<i lang="es">Mañana</i> in their food, their music, their houses,
their work—nothing thorough, nothing complete,
no heart put into anything but cock-fighting and
talk. I don’t suppose any influence could alter
these racial faults, certainly not the hasty assimilation
of mathematics, electric trams, and ice-cream
sodas. They are stupid, too, these people, with
the malicious cunning of all stupid people, and
cruel—sickeningly cruel.</p>

<p>A night or two ago we went again to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
cinématograph, but the evening was rather spoilt
by an unpleasant “incident.” While C—— was
getting the tickets, I sat on an empty bench by the
wall, whereupon a common native boy came and
sat down beside me.</p>

<p>I got up and walked away, for there were
plenty of other benches empty, and I knew this
was only an act of impudence. When C—— came
back with the tickets and saw what had happened,
he was simply furious, wanting to kick the fellow
out of the place, and pretty well out of the world
too! “You should have sat there,” he said, “and
beckoned to me to kick the brute out.”</p>

<p>But I implored him to let the thing pass
unnoticed. “For,” I said, “if you touch him you
know he will summons you, and the case will go
against you. Besides, according to the customs
of the country, the man was not doing any harm,
for he thought I was an American, and his
equal.”</p>

<p>Whereupon C—— exploded; but luckily the
door of the show was just opening, so I got him to
hurry in to secure good seats, and the “incident”
passed off. But when one thinks of the social
status of the coloured person in America!—Words
fail me!</p>

<p>We are having more drought now—the rain-water
tanks empty, and the well-water brackish.
We filter the latter, even to make tea with, which
makes the tea more palatable; but for washing, it is
like using sand-paper on the skin, and after soap has
been used the water remains perfectly clear, with
the soap in a woolly cloud at the bottom. I wish
some millionaire philanthropist would take it into
his benevolent head to help his country with this
“Trust from Heaven,” as they call the development
of the Philippines, and begin with building an
aqueduct from the hills into its second largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
town! However, the 40-acre law would stop any
extensive enterprise of that or any other sort.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Water is being brought over from Guimaras and
sold in the streets at fabulous prices, only I am
happy to say we have been lucky enough, so far, to
secure a daily supply out of a friend’s well, sufficient
to get along with if we are careful.</p>

<p>All this time I have not told you our great piece
of news, which is that we have bought a horse and
trap—or rather a pony and a <i lang="es">calesa</i>—a sort of small
dog-cart, with big, spidery wheels, to seat two,
which tips up unless a third person, generally the
groom, is sitting on a small perch behind. This is
a very light and comfortable trap, and the pony an
exceptionally good one, both being the property of
an American officer we know who is going to
Manila and selling off his effects. It is a great
stroke of luck to get hold of such a turn-out, and
we are to enter into possession in ten days or so,
or possibly longer. I shall be glad to drive, as
it is not very pleasant for ladies to walk about the
town, owing to the way the Filipinos have of shoving
white people off the footpath, when there is one,
and expectorating as close as they dare.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WHARVES—AN OLD SPANIARD</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>April 9, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>Many thanks for the book about carpentry, which
arrived quite safely by this mail, and is a treasury
of delight to C——, who has got all sorts of ideas
out of it. One of the first things he did was to
swarm up the box-room door, getting through a
flap in the matting ceiling and up into the roof,
to see what hold there would be to fix up a punkah
over the dinner-table. All the English people,
and many of the Americans, have punkahs in the
dining-room, but we have not troubled about one
so far, as we are so lucky in our splendid draught
through the hall, right across the dinner-table.
Now, however, the Monsoon is changing, and with
the wind this other side of the house, we want a
punkah badly, for, you see, if you get out of a draught
here you nearly suffocate.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Philippine Pony.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_174"><i>To face page 174.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>C—— said it was like a huge hall up in the
roof, and fearfully hot, which I could quite believe,
as the thermometer in the dark, airy rooms below
stood at 91°. Many of the houses have a sort of
small top roof, like a little hat, with a wide gap,
which acts as a ventilator, and lets off this heat
out of the space above the ceilings; but, of course,
the corrugated iron always makes a dreadfully hot
roof, however it is treated. The only cool, healthy,
and reasonable houses are the native ones of
palm thatch, but they are so very inflammable and
dangerous that no company will insure them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Though the way the native huts are lighted with
naked, flaring lights or rickety lamps, and remain
unburnt for two hours, is a marvel and a never
ceasing source of interest to us when we go about
after dark. In each grass-covered <i lang="es">carabao</i>-cart, too,
there is a flaring torch by way of complying with
the lighting regulations, and when one sees them
jolting and swaying along, it is impossible to
imagine why the regulations are not exceeded by
the whole cart going along in a blaze.</p>

<p>We went a walk last night, down this street,
through the Plaza Libertad, and down two more
streets to the Muelle Loney, the quay along the
estuary. As C—— had come back from the
office late, we did not have tea till sunset, and by
the time we went out it was nearly dark, and the
moon had not risen. The Muelle was all deep
shadows and spots of light, and the lamps in La
Paz, the suburb the other side of the river, made
long reflections of yellow light in the dark water,
while the masts and sails of the ships at anchor
stood out like Indian ink-drawings against the
deep blue sky. All along the quay are offices of
business houses, stevedores, customs, etc., and
vast <i lang="es">camarins</i> (warehouses) with low, corrugated
iron roofs, and open in front with iron bars like
colossal menagerie cages. Inside the <i lang="es">camarins</i>
could be seen shadowy piles of sacks of sugar,
which is to be detected by a certain heavy, sweet,
nauseous smell.</p>

<p>The quay itself is a very wide road, with a stone
wall going into the river—the latter deep enough
to allow steamers of a fair size, such as the <i>Kai-Fong</i>
and the <i>Butuan</i>, to come up and lie at
anchor opposite the wharves and <i lang="es">camarins</i>, as I
told you when I went to Manila. There are a lot
of curious, rusty old steamers huddled together at
the side of the quay, with open decks and fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
iron awnings, which ply between here and Negros,
and other neighbouring islands; little launches
belonging to the offices; and the big steamers that
go to Manila and Hong Kong, which all look quite
commonplace by daylight, but seemed very
mysterious in the darkness, with a light burning
here and there, and always the tinkle of a guitar,
and a voice singing softly in a minor key.</p>

<p>There was one big, dark bulk, larger than the
others, which was a Hong Kong steamer, and we
heard the funny, quacking jabber of the Chinese
crew on the fo’c’sle. They can’t get ashore in the
Philippines, as a guard is placed on the gangway,
and the captain is liable to a fine of 2000 dollars
if a Chinaman escapes ashore. Now and then one
reads in the Manila papers about a Chinaman
without a passport having been caught, sentenced
to a few months of Bilibid prison, and returned to
Hong Kong. As we passed the Chinese steamer,
I could not help thinking how tantalising it must
be for such keen, industrious men to be almost on
the soil of this Eldorado of lazy natives and high
wages. The few who do enter, as I told you, make
fortunes very quickly, or what is a fortune to
them, as well as the fortunes of those who employ
them. It is most unfortunate that popular opinion
in the far-away U.S.A. is so dead set against this
source of prosperity and revenue.</p>

<p>At intervals along the Muelle, with its jumble
of dark buildings on one side and jumble of dark
ships on the other, in front of the offices and
<i lang="es">camarins</i>, and at the corners of the little dark
alleys that turn off into the town, were numbers of
little stalls, each with a flaring naphtha light, round
which natives were sitting about laughing and
talking, and chewing betel-nut, and haggling for
hours over the price of some little bunch of eggplant,
or a tiny, insanitary fish. The wares were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
laid out on flat rush trays—bananas, maize,
horrible-looking toffee, native fruits, and tumblers
of pink <i lang="es">tuba</i>—a drink made of the sap of the palm
tree coloured red. The stall-keeper was invariably
a little brown native woman, with a huge cigar in
her thick-lipped mouth—not such cigars as are sold
at home, but a loose bundle of tobacco leaves about
four times the size of the largest cigar you ever saw,
and tied round with cotton or fibre. The way
their mouths stick out beyond their noses when
they are pulling at these big “weeds” makes their
flat faces look very funny. I saw a native girl the
other day, walking round the Plaza at Jaro, in a
very tight <i lang="es">sarong</i> and freshly-starched <i lang="es">camisa</i>,
puffing at a big black cigar all coming to pieces and
tied up with white cotton, and her swaggering gait,
and the way she looked to right and left for admiration,
displaying a profile with absolutely no nose,
was one of the most comical things I have ever had
the luck to see.</p>

<p>There are always any amount of natives along
the Muelle in the evening, for it is a favourite
lounge, and they make such picturesque groups,
loafing about the stalls or lying against the walls in
deep thought or opium. Their voices are subdued,
and they are all perfectly good-humoured, and
another point about such a crowd here is that there
is no smell from them, for the clothes of the
poorest Filipino are spotlessly white and clean, and
their bodies carefully washed. One or two costumes
made up from empty sacks amused us very much,
and they are really very effective, for the wearers
imagine the names on them to be a pattern, and
arrange the rows of letters quite carefully, generally
across the back and chest. Beyond the offices and
ships we came to immense mud-flats, which are
partially covered at high tide, and look quite nice
when they are a sheet of shallow water, but appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
depressing, and smell nasty when they are bare.
The tide was far out, and the rising moon showed up
a lot of curious tracks and channels, with planks
across them, and in the distance the backs of some
of the houses in the town. Such a desolate place!
The spot to which one would think sick animals
would crawl when they feel they are going to die.</p>

<p>A lot of little native boys were rushing and
screaming about in a remote corner, their short
shirts fluttering behind them, playing some mysterious,
meaningless game, revolving round certain
heaps of manure and dead dogs. The little chaps
seemed happy enough, but they looked so uncanny,
like little black and white imps in the moonlight.</p>

<p>In time, I daresay, all this desolate waste will
be reclaimed and built over, for someone told me
that the Harbour Company are filling it up with
dredgings. In Manila I saw a vast mud-flat being
reclaimed in the same way by harbour-dredging,
and the flattened, finished part had lines drawn on
it, which I was told were the ground plans of streets
and houses. It seems so strange to go on building
the towns out on the mud-flats in a climate like this,
when there are acres and acres of native huts
standing on sound land a few feet above the sea-level.
I asked a man who has lived here many
years why this was done, and he told me that it
was because of the great cost of transport, owing to
the high rate of wages, which would take away all
profit if one had one’s shops and <i lang="es">camarins</i> far from
the water’s edge. I said I thought it must be very
unhealthy on the mud.</p>

<p>“Absolutely fatal,” he said. “But then, you see,
it is a toss-up between a chance of fever on the
mud and a certainty of starvation in the town.”</p>

<p>I enjoy the walks about very much, or rather,
I am more interested and amused than exhilarated;
but all the same I am looking forward so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
having our trap and going for drives, and even
though there are only two roads, still we shall
be able to get out of the town. I keep thinking
that it is spring at home—or rather, I try not
to think of it! How one longs to see a bunch
of daffodils or a snow-drop; to hear a blackbird
sing; to see beautiful oaks and elms coming
into leaf instead of these eternal green palms,
and to feel fresh and invigorating air instead of
this everlasting swelter and sun!</p>

<p>We have a queer old neighbour here, an
ancient Spaniard, who lives on the ground-floor
of a house, in two rooms which are, so C—— tells
me, hung with pictures of Isabella and the King;
medals on velvet, framed and glazed; and certificates
and memorials, for he was once some official
in the Royal Household of Spain.</p>

<p>He is a courtly and dignified old person,
though about 4 feet 6 in height, and as broad as he
is long. He is very poor, and when he can sell
some piece of land, he is going back to Spain
to die.</p>

<p>This personage came to call on me a few
evenings ago, on account of having on a black
evening suit, as he had been to a funeral. We
stumbled along in Spanish, and would have done
better if my guest had not persisted in trying to
remember French so as to convince me that he
really had been in Paris. However, we got on
very well, and I showed him some of papa’s
sketches of Spain, which enchanted the poor old
thing. Over the Alhambra he waxed quite
sentimental, with his head on one side and one
podgy hand raised to heaven. Of course the
fact of my having been in his native land made
me quite charming, and compliments bloomed
like spring-flowers in the gardens of the Vega.</p>

<p>He had told C—— that he wished to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and pay his respects, as he had heard that the
<i lang="es">señora</i> had good <i lang="es">custumbres</i>, which is a Spanish
word for good breeding and good manners—not
that I mean the two can be separated, but
that the expression conveys those two, in
a sort of way. This fact he repeated to me
again, with much decorative compliment, and
many assurances that I did not look the least
like an Englishwoman—and oh, no! not a bit
like a Frenchwoman—and still less like an
Italian! Anyone would know at once that I
must be a Spaniard—and from the southern land,
where the women are elegant as flowers, and
their eyes speak of love.</p>

<p>At last he backed himself out, still showering
compliments, and offering to teach me “<i lang="es">la lengua
Castellana</i>.” His Spanish was beautiful to listen
to, so round and full and correct, and he implored
me, with his hands clasped, not to learn the
language of “<i lang="es">los Indianos</i>,” as I told you the
Spaniards call the Filipinos.</p>

<p>All the Spaniards here long and yearn for
Spain, and everything Spanish, which is only
natural, I suppose. They hate the Archipelago, as
they call it, but confess that the prospect of continuing
to earn a living here ties them by the leg.</p>

<p>Another old Spanish friend of C——’s, a man
in business, amused me very much one day, by
giving me, as one of his reasons for disliking
the Philippines, that he was in constant terror of
“<i lang="es">los Indianos</i>” coming and “click”—he drew his
finger across his throat.</p>

<p>“Really?” I said. “But you don’t, honestly,
think that, do you?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Señora</i>,” he said, “I <em>know</em> it will happen some
day. There will be such an uprising as will
wipe us all out. <i lang="es">Mi corazon</i>” (my heart) “beats
perpetually with terror.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought, however, that this life of secret
anguish could not have done much harm to the
old fellow’s system, for he looked remarkably
flourishing after thirty years of life in the tropics,
without any idea of panic at all.</p>

<p>As to this panic, I am surprised to find how
prevalent is this notion of a general uprising,
for though the Philippines are full of Insurrection,
and many of them in a state of open warfare,
still one can hardly believe that a reign of
horror could sweep over these slow little towns.
Not that the Filipinos are not capable of any
atrocities when roused—and in the War many
terrible and horrible things happened, which are
not printed in newspapers or found in books.</p>

<span class="smaller">A TRIP TO GUIMARAS—AN ASTONISHING
PROPOSAL—HOUSEBUILDING</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>April 14, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Sunday, we had the launch offered us,
so we arranged a little trip in the cool of the
evening.</p>

<p>We drove down to the Muelle Loney (too hot
to walk at five o’clock), and when we had got on
board the launch and seated ourselves in basket
chairs in the bows, she steamed down the river and
the estuary, and out into the channel. There was
a fresh breeze blowing, and the air was delicious.
As to the scenery—words fail me! The blue and
green of the sea, and the mauve and rose lights
reflected on Guimaras from the brilliant sunset
behind us over the Panay Mountains, were like
some wonderful picture wrought in amethysts and
sapphires and exquisite enamels, while all along the
shore line the groves of palm trees glowed in the
strong light like a border of emeralds set in golden
sand.</p>

<p>We crossed over, going close to the opposite
shore, with the object of visiting an old steamer
which lies over by the quarries from which
they are getting the stone to build the harbour.
This steamer used to be a French packet, and was
bought cheap by some Spaniards for inter-island
traffic, but the owners soon found she burnt her
head off with coal, and did not pay for her keep, so
now they are trying to sell her, and she has lain out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
there at anchor for a year or more; a fine old boat,
with splendid saloons and cabins all rotting away.</p>

<p>We climbed up the rickety gangway and came
up upon what looked like the ship of the Ancient
Mariner or the Flying Dutchman, all still and silent,
everything ready as if for use, but worn and rotten
with the sun and weather. We went all over her,
into the saloon with its long table of handsome,
polished wood and ghostly chairs with high, carved
backs; and into the cabins where the closed
scuttles were dark with dirt, and there was a
musty smell like bones, and our own reflections in
the cracked green mirrors made us jump. C——
said he was sure there must be a forgotten skeleton
of a pirate in one of the dingy bunks hidden by
close-drawn curtains of faded green cloth, and
really, the prospect of something of the sort seemed
so inevitable that I did not dare look in one of them!</p>

<p>We came out on the deck again, which looked
quite a cheerful place after those spectral saloons
and cabins, and we saw the galley, with dead
fireplaces, and wandered on the bridge, up a very
unsafe companion. Old Tuyay had scrambled
off the launch after us and followed everywhere,
struggling and slipping up and down stairs and
ladders, smelling about, and getting stuck somewhere
every now and then, and having to be helped
and hauled by the collar.</p>

<p>When we got back to the launch, there was still
enough daylight to make a <i lang="es">paseo</i> along the coast a
little way. We went so close to the land that we
could see right into lovely little bays, where palm-thatch
huts stood amongst the groves and the
white sands, and tiny figures were walking about or
wading in the shallows for fish. It all looked
exactly as it must have appeared on some fine
evening, when the first Spanish navigators or Captain
Cook came sailing along in their big three-deckers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
while the people ran away into the jungles and
began sharpening their arrows at the sight of a
white face.</p>

<p>We said to each other how much we should like
to be Navigators, and go about in fine ships and
land in undiscovered islands, and, if we escaped the
arrows, fire a rifle or take a photograph, and be
made kings for being so clever. Instead of doing
that, however, we steamed back to Iloilo when
darkness fell, and on landing, went to the Plaza
Libertad, where a band was playing a two-step.</p>

<p>This band which performs twice a week, on
Thursdays and Sundays, from about half-past five
to eight, is a new and delightful institution. It is
not due to any enterprise on the part of the
authorities, military or civil, but is a purely native
enterprise, consisting of a number of Filipinos who
have collected themselves together under the title
of <i lang="es">La Banda de Musica Popular</i>. They started the
notion of playing in the Plaza twice a week if they
could raise enough subscriptions, whereupon we all
paid up at once, promising to make the same
contribution every month in so good a cause. I
think our share, personally, comes to about 2 <i lang="es">pesos</i>
a month, and it is really well worth it, for now the
band is an institution, and a very good one too.
They have not got a very extensive programme—some
marches, a few “coon” tunes, an overture or
two, and some dance music—but they play with
spirit, and with the marches they are particularly
successful. It is very creditable, too, when one
thinks that this is a brass band, for the only instruments
the Filipinos are really proficient with are
the mandoline and guitar.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that the American authorities
left this very important affair to drift so that
the natives themselves, in sheer desperation,
started a band depending upon public charity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
I am not exaggerating in calling it important,
for the Filipinos, like all other Orientals, can
understand and be ruled by tangible and visible
signs of the ways of a ruling people; but the empty
bandstands in the towns, and the dull, colourless
lack of ceremonies or ceremonial of the American
<i lang="fr">régime</i> have had an extremely bad effect, though
the Filipinos are laughed at for wanting the gay,
courteous Spaniards back again. Not only is this
fact patent, but I have heard the people say so, and
they are accused of being unreasonable about
wanting the Spaniards back again after having got
rid of them; but really, quite apart from their not
having courted foreign rule at all, and loathing the
usurpation of the Americans, the Filipinos have
something to complain of in the lack of all that
pomp which an Oriental loves and understands.
The American Ideal is noble, grand—but it cannot
be compressed into an Oriental brain. I can’t make
myself better understood than by asking you to
picture what India would be if the durbars were
stage-managed by Americans!</p>

<p>We delight in the band evenings, when we sit
and watch the groups of natives walking about
under the pretty trees; the fat mothers with
coveys of slim, dark-haired daughters in fresh
muslin frocks; the young Filipino “mashers” in
white suits with straw hats worn daringly on one
side, and long, thin, tight boots, trying to hide
their shyness by a lot of swagger with a walking-stick;
and all the little comedies and flirtations
that go on. I have hardly ever seen any white
people there except ourselves; a newly-married
American couple who sit in the dark shadows very
close together, and some American soldiers in khaki
and turned-up <i lang="es">sombreros</i>. The programmes always
end with “The Star-Spangled Banner,” on which
we stand up and C—— takes his hat off, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
American soldiers unfortunately seldom trouble to
salute their Anthem—and as to the Filipinos, they
remain truculently seated with their hats on. It
makes one feel rather foolish to be the only ones to
take any notice, but C—— insists.</p>

<p>We have now entered into possession of our
trap and pony, and have had some blissful drives
along the eternal roads to Jaro and Molo, out in
the sunset and back in the starlight or moonlight,
skimming along on rubber tyres. Tracks that we
used to <em>tear</em> down when anyone lent us a carriage
are now rigorously tabooed! Everyone here drives
top-speed, and the Filipinos all crawl about the
roads, and never dream of getting out of the way
unless one shouts out a native word—“Tabé!”—when
they just move enough to avoid instant
death like a clever matador in a bull-fight. The
curious thing is we have more trouble with the
natives who are walking <em>towards</em> us instead of
those going the same way. That may sound
strange to you, and even incredible, but if you
knew the Philippines and the Filipinos you would
understand that it could not be otherwise. This
element is very exciting, and makes an ordinary
evening-drive to Molo rather better than a trip on
a fire-engine in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>I quite forgot to tell you that some time ago an
unknown man was announced and walked into
the <i lang="es">sala</i>, in the evening, just before C—— came
home. This person was an American, of about
thirty, with rather a good-looking face and the
usual thick, long hair parted in the middle. He
bowed and said:</p>

<p>“Mis’ Darncey, I guess?”</p>

<p>I said Mrs Dauncey was my name.</p>

<p>“Is your husband to home?”</p>

<p>I said he was not, and began to get alarmed,
for I thought the man had come to tell me of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
accident to C——; but he soon reassured me by
telling me he guessed I could tell him what he
wanted to know, which was whether we had a spare
room, as he was looking for a family for himself
and his wife to board with.</p>

<p>I nearly fell down flat with amazement, but I
managed, I hope, not to show my surprise, for I
remembered that the Americans live out here in
“messes,” often several families together, and
I reflected that this touting must be some curious
custom of which I had not heard. So I said, quite
politely, that I was very sorry, but I was afraid this
house was only large enough for ourselves.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, with a great deal of bowing, but
no intention of going away, “I heard this was a
big house and reckoned you didn’t fill it.”</p>

<p>“We have a room empty,” I said, “in fact we
have two, but I am afraid my husband would never
<em>hear</em> of such a thing as anyone we did not know,
or any friend, either, coming to live with us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” he said. “My wife is in
a <i lang="es">quilez</i> downstairs, and I can fetch her up to see
you and look at the rooms.”</p>

<p>At this fresh and astounding announcement, I
gasped. But I kept my temper, and replied that
I thought he need not disturb his wife, for we
had really no intention of taking anyone to live
in our house; but the man would not be convinced,
and argued the point, saying that he had been to
six other people, and he was “fair tired of going
around.”</p>

<p>I was wondering how to get rid of him, for
he was so remarkably oily and polite, and kept
on saying ma’am every two words. But just then
C—— came home, and when the visitor introduced
himself, with explanations of his mission, C——
flushed up, and I began to be afraid he would kick
the man out. But luckily the American was quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
enough to see there was no mistaking the few
words C—— said, nor the manner in which he said
them in, and he bowed himself out in a about two
seconds.</p>

<p>A strange story? But stranger still is the
fact that this was not a common man—I mean his
position was not what we call common—as C——
has found out that he is an official high up in
the Customs service, and lately married to a
schoolma’am. And stranger still is the fact that
the Americans to whom I have told this story can
see nothing odd in it at all.</p>

<p>I can’t suppose that such peculiar customs
really prevail in the United States, and that if
C—— were to call on the President’s wife, as they
are all equals, and leave me in a cab below while
he asked her if she took in boarders, that he would
not get into trouble. Fancy if this man made a
big fortune out here, and we called on him in his
mansion in New York and insisted on taking
rooms in it—the idea is preposterous—but <em>why</em>?</p>

<p>After this person had departed, we soothed our
excited nerves by sitting on the balcony and
watching one of the eternally beautiful sunsets. I
will describe it to you, for it is very much the
same every evening, with varying shades of intensity.
The sky behind the palms in the distance was
deep orange, fading into rose, and overhead into
apple-green blue. We went through the house
and out on to the Azotea, and all the sky on that
side was like a radiant, pale amethyst, with a big
bright moon rising—a great silver shield—through
the lilac and rosy mist; the water a deep sapphire
blue; and Guimaras a brilliant green outline
dividing the sea and sky. The tide was in, and the
water came up to the wall at the end of the garden,
where a sheep was nibbling grass at the end of its
tether, perfectly indifferent to a fool of a puppy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
which ran backwards and forwards barking at its
heels. In the empty stables on each side of our
own is a regular camp of poor people, who were
lounging by the well, watching one or two naked
brown babies playing on the ground. They all
looked so peaceful and happy and so picturesque
in the sunset and moonlight, that we agreed with
each other that perhaps life in the Philippines might
be quite pleasant if one only lived the right way
and had a brown skin covered by a minimum of
clothes.</p>

<p>They are a singularly happy people, these
Filipinos, when they are unspoilt by the advantages
of civilisation. One never sees or hears people
quarrelling, and they are so kind to their children—always
laughing and chattering and showing their
fine white teeth, so that to watch a group of poor
people is always a pleasure. We have been amused
for a long time by the spectacle of a house that is
being built in the suburbs, a stately go-as-you-please
undertaking that is being gone through in an
amusingly characteristic manner. They begin a
house by constructing the roof, all lashed with
<i lang="es">bejuco</i>, and very neatly put together, which sits on
the ground an indefinite time. Then the <i lang="es">arigis</i>—the
posts of bamboo or hard wood—are put in position,
and a floor is made about 15 or 20 feet from the
earth. Our friends on the Molo road got so far,
and then started to live in the bit that was finished,
camping in a sort of tent on the split-cane floor,
with the roof lying alongside on the ground. I
daresay they were “out” of <i lang="es">nipa</i> thatch, and did
not dare to trust the building out of their sight, for
the town-dwelling Filipinos are shocking thieves
and burglars. Whatever their reason was, there
they lived for quite a long time, till at last we were
quite relieved to see them begin to put thatch on
the framework. Then, one day when we passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
we saw that the roof had also been thatched and
hoisted into place, though how this latter feat was
brought about I don’t know, as we unfortunately
missed that part of the operations; but I have been
told that, when the roof has been thatched, it is
raised and put in position by sheer human force and
much advice and swearing.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_23">LETTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A TROPICAL SHOWER—OUR SERVANTS—FILIPINO
CUSTOMS</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>April 27, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing from you by the mail to-day. The
forwarding from Manila seems to be so unsatisfactory
that we think you had better begin sending
letters straight to this place. The address for the
future, therefore, will be to us to—P.O. Box 140,
Iloilo. You have to put this, as there is no delivery
of letters—a most strange and tiresome system.
In the outside wall of the post-office is a recess
with a number of pigeon holes, some glazed, some
shut with a flap, each with its own lock and key,
of which the owner keeps a duplicate. On the
wall outside is a blackboard where the arrivals and
departures of mails are chalked up, and when you
see a mail has come in, you go off and do a sort of
“bran-pie” dip in your pigeon hole to see what you
get out.</p>

<p>To-day we have had a very heavy thunderstorm,
which has filled the tanks and cooled the air, the
thermometer having gone down from 90° to 82°.
The rain came on just as I was dressing after my
<i lang="es">siesta</i>, so I hurried on a dressing-gown and went
out on to the Azotea to see about the pipe, as it
was no good blowing my whistle for a servant in
the noise of the storm and the terrific din of the
rain upon the iron roofs.</p>

<p>I found Sotero having a glorious time with a
petroleum can, which people use here for all water-carrying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
like we used to see them do in Palestine.
This can was fixed to a line, and the <i lang="es">muchacho</i> was
risking his neck to let it down so as to intercept
the overflow of a roof gutter belonging to the
people below, and filling every tin, jug, and bath the
house possessed, all spread out on the Azotea;
giving the concrete floor of the Azotea itself a
liberal wash-down at the same time. He was
hopping about the balcony, face beaming and
clothes dripping wet, and I laughed as I thought of
the conventional idea of an English butler! He is
a very good butler, all the same, or has learnt to be
one, for when he came to us he did not know how
to lay a table; while now, if we give a dinner, he
insists on arranging everything himself, and does it
perfectly, even to folding the serviettes in fancy
shapes, which he has got some other servant to
teach him.</p>

<p>All round I hear stories of the miseries and
terrors people go through with their Filipino
servants, and “the inevitable <i lang="es">muchacho</i>” is a standing
joke in the American papers. But our
retainers just jog along in perfect peace, always
in the house, always clean and tidy; and as to
their work, not only not shirking it, but improving
every day, and always ready and willing to give
any help in the stables, or anything they can
think of. I agree with my friends that we have
been very lucky in finding such excellent “boys,”
but I must take a little credit to myself too, for
having treated them with the utmost consideration
and politeness, showing them things patiently over
and over again, and never once speaking sharply
or angrily. I am sure they appreciate such treatment
instead of the way in which I see people
scolding and cursing their <i lang="es">muchachos</i>, and that our
having such good and trustworthy servants is not
entirely due to random luck in choosing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the rain has come. We shall have mosquitoes
again—they had almost disappeared in
this long drought, but an hour or two after a
shower the place is humming with them again.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Palm Sunday, on account of
which a procession was going about of all sorts
of people carrying palm branches, headed by a
<i lang="es">banda de musica</i> playing “Hiawatha,” and in the
midst a large cart covered with coloured paper,
bearing an image of some sort; all very tawdry
and crude, and not in the least picturesque.</p>

<p>In the evening, when we drove into Jaro, we
saw some Negritos from the mountains inland—the
aborigines who sometimes come down into the
towns on such occasions of <i lang="es">Fiesta</i> to do a little
trading, and beg and pick up what they can.
These people are very small, much smaller even
than the Filipinos, who are so little; and they
have quite black skins, irregular faces of real
nigger type, with big heads of fuzzy black hair,
like Bescharins. They were all very dirty and
ragged, and looked very skinny and miserable
beside the plump Malay town’s-people, and those
we saw were begging from door to door, and from
everyone they met, poor souls.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the Filipino race a child is born
with curly locks instead of the usual black, straight,
Chinese-looking hair, and this curliness is considered
a great beauty, and tremendously admired;
which is very strange, as, of course, such a trait is
only a reversion to some strain of the despised
Negrito; but the Filipinos are far too stupid to know
that. In fact, if the hair is so curly as to be
positively woolly, they are more pleased than ever.</p>

<p>On <i lang="es">Fiesta</i> days, too, certain beggars appear,
sitting by the roads displaying horrible deformities,
and praying away at an amazing rate, sometimes
with a child to run out and beg for them. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
simple, unsophisticated idea, that of having your
begging done for you, but I don’t know that the
custom is confined to Filipinos.</p>

<p>A day or two ago an American described to
me an incident of Filipino life, which I thought
very characteristic of this people. She told me
that after she first came here, she was sitting in
the house one day, when she heard a band
coming along the street playing a rattling two-step
march, so she rushed to the window and
pushed the shutter aside to see the fun, which
turned out to be a funeral, with a pale blue
coffin, decorated with garlands in carved wood
painted pink.</p>

<p>I asked her if she thought the people imagined
the occasion to be a festive one; but she said no,
that they simply did not know one sort of tune
from another, she thought, for they were walking
along in the most approved mourning style, and
as to the coffin, it was only the Filipino idea of
taste. It is curious to think what a very thin
veneer of our civilisation these people have
acquired, and how they would shed it all as
easily as my little lizard has cast off his old
coat; and would probably, as he does, feel infinitely
lighter and jollier in the primitive covering
underneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_24">LETTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">EASTER FESTIVITIES</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>April 24, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>This is Easter Monday, and since Thursday the
town has been crammed full of people—natives—and
alive with processions. We got a double
allowance of the latter, as the Aglipayanos turned
out in full force—fuller force, in fact, than the
Orthodox, and their marching and counter-marching
was most interesting, even if a little confusing.</p>

<p>We are having holidays, of course, but a holiday
here is never very complete, as the different
religions go their own way, and now, for instance,
the Chinese shops are all open; but the Spanish
and <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> establishments are shut, while the
Englishmen have all gone away, except a few juniors
left in charge. One party has gone shooting, and
they were very anxious for C—— to accompany
them, but he did not like to leave me alone here,
and refused. There is plenty of good shooting—wild
duck, snipe, etc.—but some way inland, and
the difficulty is to get there, when you are a busy
man, with only forty-eight hours to spare at rare
intervals.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">À propos</i> of shooting, C—— has only <em>now</em> got his
gun back from the Customs! It was detained by
endless dilatoriness and delays, and the finding of
the sureties, which I described to you. There was
more trouble and fuss and worry about that gun
and my little revolver than you, who have not been
in this country, would believe. Such a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
signing of papers, taking of oaths, and so forth! all
of which precautions seem remarkable and rather
superfluous in a “perfectly peaceful and contented
country.”</p>

<p>Well, C—— tried to console himself for not
going shooting by playing lawn-tennis at the Bank,
where a very good court has been marked out in a
field at the back of the house, by the estuary.
That gives you a little hint of the climate, does
it not? A grass lawn-tennis court in the hot
season?</p>

<p>We walked to the Bank and back, as the pony
had gone to be shod, and on our way home we
were stopped in the Plaza by crowds of people
evidently waiting for a procession to pass. We
got across the road as best we could, and up into
the garden in the middle of the Plaza, where we
managed to get a foothold amongst a line of people—all
natives of the poorer classes—standing on
the low wall. Just as we got there the procession
began to come past—a long double file of women in
black skirts and black or white <i lang="es">camisas</i>; the men in
mourning, which is an ordinary swallow-tail evening
suit. This was Good Friday, and the Emblems
of the Passion were borne aloft, draped in black,
while the Madonna, carried shoulder-high on a
big platform, had on a stiff, black robe; and the
whole company was moving slowly along to a guitar
and mandoline <i lang="es">banda de musica</i>, with big crape bows
on their instruments, playing slow tunes in minor
keys.</p>

<p>What do you think this procession was?—Christ’s
Funeral! The whole parade was a real
funeral procession, and the last thing of all, preceded
by acolytes in black, swinging censers with large
crape bows on them, and followed by priests in
black vestments saying (not chanting) prayers, was
a huge black and gold catafalque—the coffin made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with glass panels—through which could be seen a
wax figure of the dead Christ lying swathed in
an embroidered white satin winding-sheet, with a
last touch of realism in His head, bound with a
blood-stained handkerchief where the Crown of
Thorns had rested.</p>

<p>We waited long on the wall of the Alameda
while this weird and gruesome procession trailed
past, dwindling away down a long, straight street
to the right, with its files of bowed figures and its
great, black, swaying catafalque.</p>

<p>When we turned to come away, C—— drew my
attention to the curious fact that the Cathedral
door was shut—a most extraordinary spectacle—which
struck me as peculiar at once. At first we
could not understand the reason, and thought it
must be part of the solemnity. “Perhaps,” I said,
“they go so far as to take the procession to a
cemetery.”</p>

<p>“I know!” said C——. “They’ve shut the
doors because these fellows are the Aglipayanos!”</p>

<p>Then it also occurred to us that of course this
procession had had the native music, whereas the
Orthodox go about to the strains of a brass Constabulary
band to show that they are all right with
the Government. I must tell you, too, that on
these, and all occasions, fights are so frequent
between these sects of the followers of Christ that
the processions go about with a strong escort of
police.</p>

<p>As the tail end of the procession passed, we
looked up our street from our vantage point on the
wall, and C—— said: “What a pity we are not on
our own balcony, as they have made a round, and
are coming past the house.”</p>

<p>But I thought they could not have had time to
do that, slow as they had been, and was sure that
what we saw must be the head of the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
passing the other side of the square. It was
quite dark by now, and all the mourners carried
lighted tapers. The crowd in the square and the
procession all seemed hopelessly mixed, but when
we at last made our way to the end of our own
street, we found that we were both right about the
Funeral, for there were two of them—the tail of the
Aglipayanos was passing the end of our street,
while away up, beyond our house, the road was
blocked by the Romanists waiting to let the others
go past.</p>

<p>We tried to get up our street, but the R.C.
procession had started to come down it, so we took
refuge on a flight of stairs through an open doorway.
We had a very good view of this Funeral too.</p>

<p>It was just the same style of thing, only with
more Spaniards and Eurasians amongst the
mourners; and, following the bier of the Christ, a
dozen or so of converted Chinamen with their pigtails
lopped off. In this procession, too, the priests
were white men, but on the other hand, the Aglipayano
<i lang="es">padres</i> are all Filipinos, only we had not
been near enough to the first procession to see
their faces, which would have shown us at once
which sort they were.</p>

<p>The Papists had their drums and trumpets tied
with huge black bows, and their catafalque was a
still more gloomy erection, set round with large oil
lamps in frosted globes, and topped by great
bunches of nodding black plumes, like the old
prints of the funeral of Wellington.</p>

<p>About midnight we were awakened by the
sound of a slow, muffled band and feet shuffling
along the road, so we went out on to the balcony,
and saw the R.C. procession go trailing past, very
solemn and uncanny in the moonlight, with their
yellow taper-flames looking like little bits of gold
paper in the strong white light. This time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
had not the great catafalque with them, which, we
imagined, must signify that the Christ was at rest in
the tomb.</p>

<p>Next morning, Saturday, things were very quiet,
and the town much as usual, except for the crowds
of people everywhere, all crawling up and down the
streets in very clean clothes, with innumerable tiny
children.</p>

<p>Easter Sunday was very gay, beginning with
deafening bells well in the dark hours of the morning,
when even the cocks had hardly begun to tune
up for the day. The great excitement was a
children’s carnival (at the end of Lent!), got up by
the Spanish Club; which event resolved itself into
the inevitable procession through the streets, for
these people are as inveterate procession-walkers
as the Swiss; and whatever comes off, they turn
out and walk about the streets, quite conceited and
perfectly happy, taking the whole mummery with
invulnerable seriousness.</p>

<p>These children were really a very pretty sight,
though, and the little things seemed to be enjoying
themselves immensely. At about four o’clock they
began to assemble, forming up and marching round
the Plaza, and then up the Calle Real to the
Gobierno (the Government buildings), round the
grass plot in front of that building, back and down
the street parallel to this, and finally along here,
when we saw them from our balcony.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest cars was got up as the Sea,
with clouds of pale green and blue tulle, the back
of the car a great fan-shaped shell, in which sat a
very pretty little <i lang="es">Mestiza</i> girl dressed as a mermaid,
with a long pasteboard tail, and driving two swans.
Another was “the world”—a huge globe with the
four continents sitting one at each corner; another
was a monster basket full of a miscellaneous collection
of ballet-fairies, toreadors, Faust and Mephistopheles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
gipsies, and so forth, all very solemn and
perfectly happy. One tiny person of two years old
was dressed as a cupid in pink muslin and roses—such
a darling—and one little girl was a funny
wee clown, as broad as she was long.</p>

<p>After they had all gone past, we went to the
Spanish Club to see the prize-giving, which was
very amusing. “Iloilo at a glance” was squeezing
and surging about in the big room upstairs, and I
thought the floor must cave in; but Mr M——, who
is a member of that club, told me it was all right, as
they always put props under the floor for a <i lang="es">funcion</i>,
a characteristically Spanish and haphazard idea.</p>

<p>There was a band playing somewhere, and in an
alcove a big tea-table spread out, while the whole
of one wall was lined with long tables displaying
the prizes—really lovely toys.</p>

<p>We walked about, talking to the children, all
very keen to show off and explain their costumes,
and the mermaid immensely proud of the little
wheel on which her tail moved along the floor.
One miniature couple in evening dress, looking like
grown-up people seen through the wrong end of a
telescope, were well worth watching and following
about, for neither of them would have sacrificed
his or her dignity to a smile for anything in the
world.</p>

<p>The prize-giving went by vote, but the poor
mites who had not got prizes were consoled by toys
doled out in a novel and pretty fashion at the end
of the show. I fancy I have seen it somewhere in
a cotillon, but can’t be sure. From the ceiling hung
two huge Japanese umbrellas, with coloured ribbons
dangling from each spoke, and when they were
lowered at the end, the children filed past underneath,
each taking off a ribbon and tearing away to
see what present it was good for. We saw the
little man, of the couple in evening dress, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
about showing off his prize—the first prize, I think
it was—which was a beautiful doll. Then, to our
astonishment, we found that the couple were a pair
of little sisters, Filipinas, of course, for there were,
none but Filipino, Spanish, and <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> children
taking part in the <i lang="fr">fête</i>, though all the American
Colony, as they call themselves, were in the room.
I think there are very few American children here,
and those that there are look miserably white,
and thinner even than the Spanish or <i lang="es">Mestizo</i>
youngsters.</p>

<p>We left about seven, before the rush, as we had
the trap waiting outside, and the last thing we saw
was the mermaid showing somebody her tail and
the poor clown crying sleepily on her mother’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a <i lang="es">baile</i>, which we
summoned up energy to turn out for, but it was
hardly worth the effort, as the floor had been spoilt
by boots in the afternoon, while the band, half
asleep, poor creatures, played intolerably slow and
mournful music, to which the dancers crawled
languidly about, for it was a very hot night, without
a breath of air anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_25">LETTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">A DAY AT NAGABA</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>April 30, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We went last Sunday to spend the day at Nagaba,
a native village opposite Iloilo, in the island of
Guimaras. We took the trip at the invitation of
some friends who had gone to spend Saturday to
Monday in a native house which happened to be
empty and available for hire. I have often wanted
to visit some of the places about, but the great
difficulty is how to put up, for there are no inns,
and no lodgings to be had in the villages. One
can’t go anywhere and back in a day, unless just
across to Guimaras, but even that entails going out
in the heat of the day, which is never very pleasant
or very safe.</p>

<p>We were lucky, however, in this trip to Nagaba,
as the sky was cloudy and the breeze very fresh,
and, though we left as late as ten in the morning,
we did not suffer from the heat. I am constantly
reminded of a certain book of adventure, which as
children we used to love, called <cite>The Coral Island</cite>.
It is by Ballantyne, I think—you remember it, I
am sure? Do you remember the pictures of
the three boys in the Tropic Island, standing in
white sunshine, and wearing loose caps or no hats
at all? and all the stories of their adventures, and
how they set off at “about the middle of the day”
in a canoe with sufficient meat and vegetables to
last for a week, and how they went in this fashion
to other small islands? This did not seem to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
odd as a child, of course; and I daresay I saw
nothing peculiar in the daily life of <cite>The Swiss
Family Robinson</cite>, either; and probably should
have raised no objections to any of these stories
a few months ago, or minded a bit being told that
English boys went about unscorched and alive with
no protection from the tropic mid-day sun, or that
meat was fit to eat after one day in a canoe, much
less one week!</p>

<p>Well, we got over to Guimaras in a very short
time, landing from the launch in a small boat, from
which C—— and I and the friend who was with
us were carried ashore by our servants, who had
come with us—we had also, by request, brought
our plates, knives, forks, and tumblers!</p>

<p>The house we were going to was situated on a
small rocky steep leading up from the beach, a
few hundred yards from a tiny village of brown
<i lang="es">nipa</i> huts amongst the green bushes and palms
in a bay at the mouth of a river. The house
was a regular native dwelling, built on high poles
of bamboo, with walls of <i lang="es">nipa</i>, and floors of pieces
of split cane half an inch or so apart for coolness.
The whole abode consisted of one very big room,
part of which was partitioned off as a bedroom,
while all along one side of the house towards the
sea ran a broad balcony, built out over the rocks,
and shaded by tall thickly-leaved trees, with a
glorious view of the blue bay, the open green sea,
and a bit of rose-purple Panay in the distance.
I don’t think I ever saw a more lovely spot, and I
could not help reflecting how different life in the
Philippines must be to those who can live in such
places as Nagaba instead of a street in a town.
Though, to be practical, I suppose the food would
be even worse, and ice—but one could not get
less ice than we do now in the town.</p>

<p>Some of us spent all the morning loafing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and talking on the balcony, enjoying the deep
shade and the fresh breeze blowing straight in from
the open sea. One of the men of the party had
contrived to catch the <i lang="es">anting-anting</i> lizard of the
house, such as I described to you as having
a call like a cuckoo and being considered very lucky
by the Filipinos. He had tethered the creature
by a piece of cotton tied round its body, so as
to keep it for me to see when I arrived, and
it was much larger than I had expected—about a
foot long—and not unlike the desert lizards one sees
dried in the bazaars in Upper Egypt, only the skin
of the “Philippine cuckoo” is all a pattern of
green and red. The poor thing was tame enough,
but very shy, and inclined to get behind furniture
or skirts, so when I had had a good look at it, they
let it go again, when it vanished into the thick
fringe of <i lang="es">nipa</i> that protected the sides of the
balcony. This <i lang="es">nipa</i>, when one sees it close at hand,
is a sort of palm leaf folded in two, lengthways,
and tied to frames of bamboo, but it makes very
nice, cool houses, and is absolutely waterproof.</p>

<p>One of the trees that shadowed the house was
an Ylang-Ylang, from which the scent of that
name is extracted; a tall, naked, light brown, smooth
stem, with thin branches spreading out at the top,
and leaves like an acacia. The perfume is in the
small green blossom, which is not at all unlike
that of a lime, and with infinite difficulty one or
two of these were pulled down by means of a
fishing-rod, and given to me to dry and put in
my linen-cupboard in the native fashion. They
dried up in a very few hours, but kept their
delicious scent, and when I came home, I put them
amongst my handkerchiefs, which are sweetly
perfumed with them already.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Native Houses.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_204"><i>To face page 204.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>Some of the men spent a riotous morning in
a fresh-water swimming bath in a grove near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
house. There is a spring of perfect water, which
is brought in pipes past the house and out in long
bamboo pipes on stands in the shallow water,
where ships come and take it in to supply steamers,
or to sell over in Iloilo. The flow of water is very
great, enough to supply a city, and the main pipe
is so contrived that by pulling out a plug one fills
the swimming bath, which is a wonderful luxury.</p>

<p>We heard the others splashing and shouting in
the swimming bath all the morning, and when lunch
time came, they appeared radiant and starving, and
I have not seen men do such justice to their food
since I came to the Philippines.</p>

<p>After lunch we all settled down in various
chosen nooks for a <i lang="es">siesta</i>, and our servant Sotero,
who is a native of Nagaba, came and asked permission
to go away for the afternoon, which surprised
our friends very much, for they said they had
never heard of a Filipino servant taking anything
but “French leave.”</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to acquire the habit
of sleeping in the middle of the day, which is
perhaps one of the reasons why I never feel well
out here. So I sat about, and looked at some
picture papers, and felt very tired—I could cheerfully
have gone round to the sleeping forms and
done them some injury simply because they could
sleep!</p>

<p>About four C—— awoke, so we went a little
walk amongst the rocks close to the house, and
thought we were exploring the whole island!</p>

<p>We wandered about amongst scrub and rocks
above the shore, where we came suddenly to a tiny
hut perched up amongst big grey boulders, with
fishing nets spread out to dry and a native lounging
in the window-space. It looked such a nice little
hut, just one large palm-thatch room on high poles,
with a rickety step-ladder up to the door, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
a round comfortable cat was sitting watching the
fowls pecking about below. A little farther on we
came to the banana patch, with brilliant green
plants growing on a nook of dark earth amongst
the grey rocks. All the rocks were very sharp;
volcanic, with rough edges, which cut our shoes,
even when we followed a tiny winding track. After
we got to a little height, we could look down on
the village and the sea and bay, which all appeared
most bright and beautiful in the long rays of the
low sun, and all so peaceful and quiet.</p>

<p>We turned back again by a path which struck
more inland, past some more little banana fields
and another little hut with its back to a tiny
precipice. It is strange how near the towns the
primitive sets in, for the people in both lots of huts
were quite shy of us, and the children ran away
and hid; while in the village, through which we
passed, by making a round across some rice-fields,
the people were quite country-folk, not a
bit like the cheeky, independent loungers in the
towns; answering one quite civilly and even happily
when one spoke to them.</p>

<p>The village was delightfully quaint, all built on
high poles planted in the sand of the shore, with
many cheerful brown folk hanging out of the open
sides of the houses, while mangy dogs with pups and
fat old sows with immense families sprawled about
down below. There are always quantities of pigs
in a Philippine village, for, as I think I told you,
they are the scavengers, and though the natives
are not more unkind to those benefactors than to
any other animals, to call one of them a pig is a
frightful insult. In spite of all this, the favourite
and most esteemed Filipino delicacy is sucking-pig,
roasted whole.</p>

<p>Beyond the village we went across a field of
emerald grass, bordered by a deep green hedge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
curious bushes with no flowers on them. Our
friends told us that these plants come into bloom in
the wet Monsoon. Now, with the hot weather a
very beautiful tree is in flower everywhere, called
the Fire tree, which was only naked brown
branches for a long time, and then burst into huge
bunches of brilliant scarlet blossoms, rather like
orchids, and very handsome at a distance, but
coarse and common close at hand. The effect of
these masses of showy red against the vivid green
palms is wonderful and almost too bright. There
is one of these Fire trees in the garden of the house
opposite to us, here in Iloilo, which is a gorgeous
display, and a delight to me just to look at as I sit
here writing.</p>

<p>But, to get back to Nagaba, though there is not
much to tell you, except that some of our friends
joined us, and we ended our walk by a stroll
through a cocoanut grove, where we saw an old
man in a loin-cloth going up a tree to get the sap
from which they make the <i lang="es">tuba</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He had a long
vessel made of a section of bamboo tied across his
back, and a little round bowl of half a cocoanut
tied in front of his body, with a big sharp knife
beside it. He ran up the tree by means of notches
cut all the way up the trunk, and at the top he tied
the vessel under a bunch of buds, putting in it some
of the stuff out of the bowl, which was red bark to
dye the drink pink. This beverage I think I have
mentioned to you before. One sees it anywhere,
and the long tumblers of pink liquid are a feature
in every little native shop.</p>

<p>This vessel they leave there for twelve hours,
during which the sap drips out of the palm, and in
the morning the man goes up and takes down the
bamboo, now full of <i lang="es">tuba</i>, which is very fresh and
nice, and tastes of cocoanut and water, and is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
wholesome, not to say medicinal. If it is left, however,
the <i lang="es">tuba</i> rapidly ferments, and by the evening
is a very strong intoxicant, which constitutes the
peculiar devil of the Philippines, and is the cause
of most of the deterioration, physical, moral, and
mental, of the race.</p>

<p>When the American Army first came out to
the Philippines, the temperance enthusiasts in the
U.S.A. hearing that a good deal of drinking was
going on out here, started an agitation, by means
of which they got the Army Canteens in the
Philippines abolished. The result of this drastic
mothering was that the soldiers went off and got
<i lang="es">tuba</i>, about which, of course, the good folk
in America knew nothing. Frightful scandals
happened, which unfortunately did harm to the
American prestige, and even the restoration of the
canteens has not swept away the folly and evil
which were thus begun.</p>

<p>This cocoanut grove, by the way, is kept for
<i lang="es">tuba</i>, as are most of the palms one sees near the
houses, for when the sap is taken in this way no
fruit appears. Growing cocoanuts is one of the
most lucrative speculations in the Philippines, as a
tree bears fruit when it is six or seven years old,
about a hundred nuts a year, the income yielded by
a tree being about 2 <i lang="es">pesos</i>. So a grove of ten
thousand trees or so is a very paying concern, if
only the planter does not make the mistake, which
I, myself, have often noticed, of placing his trees
too close to one another, so that they do not get
enough room to spread out at the top and find
light and air.</p>

<p>We turned back from the cocoanut grove by a
different path, and went back to the house along
the beach. As the tide was far out, we walked
across the firm, damp sand, where there were
myriads of tiny crabs of bright metallic blues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and reds and greens, which all darted sideways
into holes as soon as one got within a yard of
them.</p>

<p>After tea we loafed on the balcony, watching a
lovely gold and rose sunset, while sailors and
others took boxes and things down to the boat; and
the man carrying our gear slipped on the rocks, and
our plates and tumblers fell out and smashed to a
thousand pieces. When it was almost dark, we
returned in the launch to Iloilo, quite enchanted
with our day at Nagaba and with the house on the
rocks. We are determined to go over there one
Saturday to Monday by ourselves, for it is a delightful
change.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MONSOON—AN ITALIAN OPERA COMPANY</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>May 5, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I had two sweet little love-birds sent me yesterday,
sitting jammed up in a tiny dirty cage in which
they had travelled from China. They looked so
uncomfortable and draggled, poor scraps, that I
set off after my <i lang="es">siesta</i>, and went “down town,”
as the Americans call it, to see if I could get a
cage for them. More Philippine shopping! I
explained and argued at all sorts of emporiums,
but no one had anything the least like a bird
cage. At last I thought the wonderful English
store might produce one, and when I got there,
they said they thought they had something of
the kind, made of wood, of native manufacture. I
said I thought that would do very well, so after a lot
of rummaging in a <i lang="es">camarin</i>, some very nice cages
were found—large and clean, and made of split
bamboo, with a little red and green paint here
and there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus15">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Track of a Typhoon.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_210"><i>To face page 210.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>I was delighted—till I found there was no
mistake about their having been made by a
Filipino! No water-pipkin; no tray to slide out;
a door so small that I could only squeeze my hand
into the cage with difficulty; and <em>no perches</em>! It
was all there was to be had in Iloilo, however,
so I took it with me, and climbed in under the
apron of the <i lang="es">calesa</i>—it was raining very hard—and
took my cage home and told the servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to make perches. This they did with considerable
skill, and the results looked very nice, but when
I put the birds on them, the poor things instantly
tumbled off into the soap-dish full of water, which
was meant for them to drink from. After a lot of
anxious thought, it occurred to me that the perches
were much thinner than those in the little cage
the birds had arrived in, and perhaps they could
not wrap their long toes round these; and this
was evidently the trouble, for as soon as larger
ones were made and fixed in, the couple got up
and stuck on, whispering to each other how nice
the new perches were.</p>

<p>Of course the cat wants to eat them, and glares
with greedy eyes, while old Tuyay is fearfully
puzzled, coming to look intently, and snuffing very
long and hard, which the wee birds don’t mind
a bit. They are such sweet things, with their
tiny chirpings and pretty ways.</p>

<p>There is a strong S.-W. Monsoon blowing now—warm
and tiring—and one’s skin feels sticky and
uncomfortable. In a month or two, however, this
will be the chronic condition of the atmosphere, and
will go on till October, but I suppose one gets
used to it after a time, as to everything else.
Yesterday a Typhoon was signalled by the
meteorological office, but it has not arrived yet,
and I hope it won’t come our way at all, for the
circular winds that sweep over these islands are
the most frightful storms, tearing up trees, whipping
off corrugated roofs, and setting the <i lang="es">nipa</i>
houses on fire.</p>

<p>There are a great many rats here, which eat
up whatever the cockroaches don’t finish—<i>i.e.</i>,
whatever is not in glass jars or tins. They get
through nearly as many potatoes—at the price
of new potatoes at home in May—as we do, so
I invested in a large wire trap, which was set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
in the <i lang="es">dispensa</i> ten days or more ago. The boys
and the <i lang="es">sota</i> (groom) watched the trap with the
keenest interest, but never a rat would get into
it to oblige them. Now, however, while I was
writing this, Domingo came in, beaming, with the
trap in his hand, and a huge grey rat in it.
“What are you going to do with it?” I asked.
“Are you going to kill it?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si, señora</i>, by pouring petroleum on the rat
and setting it alight.” He was astonished and
obviously disappointed when I peremptorily forbade
this horrible rite, which the Filipinos have
learnt from the Chinese, who think that the poor,
agonised, blazing animal runs away with the ill-luck
of the house.</p>

<p>Then he suggested boiling water, and was again
disappointed and surprised when I didn’t join in
this spree either, and went off quite gloomily to
carry out my orders—to find something large
enough to stand the trap in so as to drown the
poor beast as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Nothing could be found, till the <i lang="es">sota</i> fetched a
tub from the stables, and this I made them fill with
all the bath water—fresh water being far too
precious to waste, even on sentiments of humanity!
They collected all the water they could, and finally
the flood reached the top of the cage, and though
the sight of the rat struggling made me feel deadly
sick, I waited till he was stiff and cold, as I did
not know what cruelty these “little brown
brothers” might not indulge in if left to their
own devices.</p>

<p>The cook had been at market, and Sotero had
gone shopping, so there was not the crowd there
might have been on the Azotea, and only half the
advice. They don’t get excited, these Filipinos,
unless they are fighting or massacring—one does not
see frenzied little groups shouting in each other’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
faces, and throwing their fingers about like Italians,
or low-class Arabs, or people like that—they are
very slow, and their voices always soft and gentle.
I mean the Filipinos, for the <i lang="es">Mestizos</i> differ from
them in this, as well as in having curiously harsh,
discordant voices, by which one readily detects
their breed.</p>

<p>We went a night or two ago to a performance
given by a wandering Italian Opera Company,
who were really very good indeed, acting remarkably
well, and possessing good voices. Three of
them sang in various selections, and the fourth
conducted an orchestra of bare-footed, flat-faced
natives in ragged <i lang="es">camisas</i>, whose battered old
straw hats hung about the footlight-board and on
the piano.</p>

<p>The conductor played the piano splendidly,
with incredible energy in such heat, and the
result that he knocked out of his orchestra was
astonishing. The theatre was very full, and we
had shared a box with some friends, all sitting
with our knees jammed together in a pattern like
the ornamentation on a runic cross.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the show immensely, but, oh, it
was hot! And if we, looking on, felt faint with
the heat, what must it have been for the performers
and for the <i lang="fr">Chef d’orchestre</i>! Talking of heat, the
thermometer now averages 90° to 93° all day in the
dark, airy house, and a little while ago, when we
got some ice by luck and manœuvring, I put the
thermometer in the ice chest, and it only went
down to 80°!</p>

<p>We have taken the house at Nagaba for next
Saturday to Monday, and are busy making preparations
for going over, with an anxious eye on
the sky above and the weather-cock in the garden
opposite. One has to take a good deal to the
house at Nagaba, as all they provide is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
four walls, a table, some chairs, a big native
bed, and one or two hard cane couches. For
this, however, one pays the same price a day as
at a big London hotel for bed and breakfast for
two people!</p>

<span class="smaller">A WEEK-END AT NAGABA</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>May 8, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We were just going to Nagaba when I finished
my last letter, I think, and now we have just
returned, after having had a most delightful time
over there.</p>

<p>We went over in the launch on Saturday, leaving
here at half-past four, and to look at the start from
here you would have thought we were going for
good to China or Japan!</p>

<p>Before we set out, we sent a boy for a <i lang="es">carabao</i>-cart,
inside which the gear was stowed:—two rolls
of bedding; some large wooden cases with household
effects; C——’s suit-case with what clothes
we had to take; and Sotero sitting behind, carrying
a mysterious bundle, with the cook beside him, got
up in a clean pink and green muslin <i lang="es">camisa</i> and blue
cotton trousers, carrying C——’s panama in one
hand, and a long sack full of his beloved pots and
pans in the other. C—— and I and Tuyay followed
in the <i lang="es">calesa</i>, leaving Domingo in charge of the
house, under oath to <i lang="es">mucho quedado</i> (take great
care), but rather gloomy at not being in the
outing.</p>

<p>At the Muelle Loney we embarked, with friends
waving to us from the office windows as if we were
going away for ever. The day was perfect and the
crossing lovely, but a slight swell made it rather
difficult for us to tranship into the small boat we
had towed over. When we got to the other side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
C—— did the complete and efficient sailorman
in stowing the gear in the boat, handing me down
(something after the fashion of the Arabs at Jaffa)
into the cook’s embrace, and giving orders generally;
but he spoilt the whole effect by falling into the boat
right on top of me, and bonneting me in my own
topee, at which <i lang="fr">debâcle</i> the cook showed all his
dark red betel-stained teeth from ear to ear, and
even Tuyay laughed.</p>

<p>The tide was very far out, showing long
stretches of wet sand and reefs, all shining in the
sunlight, with strips of very blue water in between.
C—— quite redeemed his reputation for sailorising
as he steered the boat ashore by the colour of the
water over the sand banks; and we managed to
get not very far from the front of the house, which
we could just manage to make out amongst the
trees and rocks, but the water-pipes on the bamboo
frames going out into the sea, showed us where to
look. The crew and the servants waded ashore,
carrying gear, and Tuyay was chucked out and
splashed along with them, while two skinny brown
ragamuffins made a “chair” of their arms, and
carried me—with puffings and groanings, so rude!—to
land, and set me down on the beach with a
sigh of relief. After landing me and the <i lang="fr">ménage</i>,
C—— rowed back to the launch to put the sailors
on board, and she steamed away to Iloilo again.
Coming back in the boat alone, he tied her up to a
fish <i lang="es">corral</i>—a sort of wattle fence in the shallow
water—and then waded ashore and came gingerly
up the sharp rocks.</p>

<p>By the time he arrived I had unpacked, and it
was about half-past five, so we put on bathing suits
and filled the swimming bath, and the fun began at
once. It was delicious, after the long, hot day, to
splash about in the cool, fresh water, and we
stayed there till it was quite dark, and we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
see stars shining in the patches of dark sky
between the branches. By-the-bye, I often think
how strange it seems to see the same old Orion’s
Belt and Cassiopeia looking down on us here. We
see the Southern Cross, too, low on the horizon—a
disappointing exhibition, and no one would think it
was meant for a cross unless they were told so.</p>

<p>We dined early, and were hungry, which was
delightful. The cook and Sotero managed wonderfully,
so that we were just as comfortable as in our
own delightful house. There was a firefly flitting all
about the big room, looking so pretty; appearing
and disappearing like a tiny fairy light.</p>

<p>Next morning, when I woke up, I heard only a
few cocks crowing—nothing to speak of—and some
twitterings of birds as well, and I think the latter
pleased me as much as the whole trip! In the
Philippines “the birds have no song and the
flowers have no scent,” they say, which is a sweeping
generalisation, but true for the most part.</p>

<p>We put on our bathing suits, had a cup of tea,
and were out on the beach by six o’clock. The
tide was far out again, with long stretches of shining
wet, ribbed sand; the sea all fresh and blue, and
glittering in the sunlight. But where we went was
still in shade, for the sun had not yet come up
behind the Guimaras hills, and the morning air was
exquisite. We “ran races in our mirth” along the
wet sands, till we got opposite the fish <i lang="es">corral</i>, where
the water was deeper and the boat was tied up to
a bamboo pole.</p>

<p>As we went along the beach, we saw people
from the little huts we passed when we were here
before, washing at a spring of water which flowed
out from the rocks and down to the beach. They
were some way off, though, and we were in the
shade and they were in the still deeper shade under
the cliffs, so we could not make them out very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
clearly, but we could see their coppered-coloured
skins shining with water, and hear them laughing
and talking.</p>

<p>We swam about the boat for a long time, and
found the water quite warm in the shallows, even
before the sun was up. I had brought C——’s
panama, which I hung to the fish <i lang="es">corral</i> while I
swam about in the shade, but when we went back
to the house, I had to wear it, as the sun which
was then on us is oppressively hot here as soon as
it rises.</p>

<p>The fish <i lang="es">corral</i>, by-the-bye, is an ingenious trap,
rather after the fashion of a maze, into which the
fish enter but never have the sense to get out
again.</p>

<p>When we got back to the house, we filled the
swimming bath, which felt very cold after the sea,
and it certainly washed off the salt water, but it
was nearly as hard and harsh as the sea itself.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Filipino Market-Place.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_218"><i>To face page 218.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>In the early morning a fleet of <i lang="es">paraos</i> (native
sailing boats) goes across to Iloilo to the market
with fowls, mangoes, maize, pine-apples, etc., and
our cook took passage in one of these vessels to go
and do his marketing, for it is impossible to buy a
single thing in Nagaba, where the people only just
keep enough for their own scanty consumption. He
returned about nine o’clock, and I went into the
kitchen to inspect the result of his shopping.
The kitchen was in the regular native fashion, just
a prolongation of the living-room, with the same
split-bamboo floor, through which could be seen the
fowls and pigs wandering about under the house.
There was no ceiling below the thatch and rafters,
and everything seemed very nice and trim—the fireplace
being a high table of concrete with holes in the
top. In each hole they light little pieces of charcoal,
so that each pot has its own fire, which seems
a cumbersome method, but it saves fuel, and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
be quite enough trouble for a Filipino, who has
probably one pot of rice to boil and no more.
From the roof hang all sorts of dried fruits or
vegetables, and queer little bundles of herbs for
flavourings and for medicines as well. I noticed
that amongst the things the cook had brought he
had not forgotten the day’s supply of <i lang="es">buyo</i>. When
first I used to go into the kitchen here to look at
the day’s supplies, I saw this little packet, not unlike
a lily-leaf, tied up with a wisp of twine, and
classed it amongst the mysterious little odds and
ends intended for flavourings. But one day I had
the curiosity to ask, and the cook, with much shyness
and shrugging up of his shoulders, told me it
was <i lang="es">buyo</i> (betel-nut). I could quite believe it when
I looked at his crimson teeth, and was thankful the
supply was only for himself and not the other
servants, for I could not stand being waited on at
table by a person with a mouth as if he had been
drinking fresh blood. The betel-chewers expectorate
a great deal, though they can’t possibly do
so more than their compatriots and the Spaniards
and Americans, but the red expectoration is
horrible, somehow, and I’ve often seen all the
pavement outside a house or shop quite crimson
with the great splashes of betel-juice ejected by the
inmates.</p>

<p>We spent all the morning pottering about and
reading, and regretting that we could not carry out
our plan of bathing again when the tide was up
and deep below the house, as we were expecting a
party of English and American friends from Iloilo,
who had announced that they would visit us on
Sunday morning. But the party never landed after
all, which was rather a disappointment, as we were
done out of our bathe, besides having no use for
a dozen or two of sodas which we had brought
over with infinite trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>After the <i lang="es">siesta</i>, we thought we would make use
of the boat for a little trip, so we sent into the village
for two men who could row; and they fetched her
to the beach and rowed us up the little estuary, past
the village and up the river. Unfortunately, the tide
had gone out again—very far out—and the river
was too low to go as far as we had intended, which
was to a convent and church, the corrugated roofs
of which we had seen from a height. So we just
went a little way up the narrow, muddy river, but
we could not see much as we were below the level
of the thick bushes that fringed the banks. At
last we stuck and could get no further, so we
turned back and went up a little back-water, and
landed by a queer sort of lime-kiln in a palm-grove.</p>

<p>We scrambled ashore, and walked up a track
through the woods of mangoes and palms, till we
got up a good height, with a map view of the river
winding far below and a glimpse of the roofs of the
convent. Down in the valley the land was all cultivated,
chiefly in maize-fields and bananas, which
looked green enough though uninteresting, but the
hills were pretty, and wooded with trees of all tones
of green, and the distances exquisite in gradations of
mauves and blues. From where we stood, the sea
was quite hidden, for we had our backs to it, and
the hill between us and it; and the view spread out
below was like some tropical version of the valley
of the Doons. We went on up through the wood,
still big dark mango trees with leaves like laurels—dark
and shiny—and feathery, graceful cocoanut-palms
in between. The ground was all covered
with straggling plants, wild mint, and dead palm-branches,
while wild pine-apples grew in quantities,
each fruit sitting in a flat bush of spiky yellowish
leaves, and looking delicious!</p>

<p>By a very primitive hut in a clearing we came
upon some natives, clad only in short white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
drawers, who were very nice and cheerful; very
different from the people in the towns. They
knew very little Spanish, but we made out that
their chief occupations were gathering the fruit of
the pine-apples for food and the leaves to make
into the thread to weave the <i lang="es">piña</i> muslin. They
made charcoal too, and all this information C——
elicited in Visayan and a few words of Spanish.
I don’t suppose they trouble themselves much
about even those simple occupations, and I should
think the less thought they gave to the blessings
of civilisation the happier they would be. What
good on earth can education, whisky, votes,
appendicitis, electric light, a free press, frozen
meat, clothes, and pianos do to such happy simple
souls? It seems so odd to think that in one part
of the world cultivated, thinking men are trying
their level best to destroy for others an ideally
happy, simple life, while at home their one profession
is a wish to return to it themselves, and
their only idea of a holiday is to go off and camp in
the Rockies, where they can approach as nearly as
possible to the conditions one sees here in the
country places. Indeed, as I told you, far from
encouraging a simple, agricultural life, the land and
other taxes, and the education they go to maintain,
are having the effect of choking agriculture and
hurrying the half-taught countrymen into the
towns.</p>

<p>But even with the elect, with the Filipinos,
the sums of money raised should be spent on roads,
on remitting the poll-tax, on reducing the export
duties—and then, when a generation or two has
been peaceful and well fed, it would be time enough
to educate the masses—if such universal education
is necessary or beneficial to such a people, or any
people at all. In the white countries, with all
their thousands of years of progress through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Greece, Rome, and the Middle Ages, one can’t
be sure, judging from the tone of literature that
appeals to the masses, whether education has been
an unmitigated boon; but hastily to apply the
same methods to this infinitely lower development
of the human race, is an absurdity that would be
laughable if it were not pitiful and dangerous.
And it seems so strange to think of a country
being governed against its inclinations, not by
legislators trained in its problems, but by a body of
electors on the other side of the world, not one
of whom knows more of its conditions and needs
than the first cabman one would hail in London
or Paris. Strange, is it not, when you come
to think of it?</p>

<p>Well, to get back to our trip up the river
in Guimaras, we came down through the woods
again, and got into our boat about sunset,
rowing back to the beach opposite the house
in a pale crimson sunset glow, with long dark
shadows of trees and houses falling on the sand,
and when we got out at the house, we walked
up over the rocks and pools, and saw the little
bright metallic-looking crabs running into their
holes again. We tried very hard to catch one,
but it was impossible, for they run sideways at
a great pace, simply vanishing like so many
harlequins of crab-land.</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_222"><i>To face page 222.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>We dined early, and spent the evening in
long chairs on the balcony. It was a lovely night,
fresh and cool, probably not more than 85°, with
great stars shining brightly, making quite a silver
light upon the sea. Many people from the village
were out in the bay, wading in the shallows, and
catching fish with spears and torches, shining a
light on the water, and then plunging down a spear
and bringing up the poor deluded fish. A man
ran out from under our house, carrying a bamboo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
staff about 12 feet long, dipped in something
resinous, and flaming at one end, and we saw
another man join him, and they waded far out,
till the torch was only a little speck of yellow in
the silvery night. That was all very nice and
primitive, but on the rocks below sat another
engaging barbarian, squatting on his heels getting
crabs out of the pools, and whistling “Hiawatha”
perfectly in tune.</p>

<p>We had a very early start next morning, turning
out at half-past five, and packing and breakfasting
as soon as it was light, for we had to be
back in Iloilo in time for C—— to be at his
office at eight o’clock. We had not been able
to get the launch to come and fetch us, so, when
we were on our way back from the river the
night before, we had stopped by the village and
made arrangements to take one of the <i lang="es">paraos</i>
lying at anchor there—long, thin frames of bamboo
covered with <i lang="es">bejuco</i> matting, tarred inside and out,
in shape sharp and narrow as a blade, with big
canvas sails and great wide outriggers. The
crews of these boats consist of several men, one
of whom steers while the others control the sails
or run out on the outriggers, for the art of sailing
them consists in a very skilful balance, according
to the direction of the wind; and breezes here
are known as “one-man” or “three-man” winds
and so on, by the number of men that would be
required on the outriggers of a <i lang="es">parao</i>. They are
said to be safe enough, but they look very risky,
and skim over the water like swallows, also
they draw very little water, and can anchor in very
shallow places.</p>

<p>We got on board our <i lang="es">parao</i>, the <i>Soltero</i>, by
about seven o’clock, and had a lovely, fresh three-man
breeze, a glorious sunny morning, and I
wished the crossing could have taken half a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
instead of half an hour. C—— and I sat on
the little narrow plank that served as deck; while
the other half of the boat, where the “deck”
stopped, was full of rolls of bedding and gear,
and on top of all, sat the cook still clutching the
panama and his sack of pots and pans. The boat
towed behind, with one of the wooden cases in it,
guarded by Sotero, holding in his arms a large
and handsome rooster, to buy which he had asked
for an advance upon his wages. I don’t like
cock-fighting, and was depressed by the sight of
this poor animal; but it would be silly to make a
fuss and perhaps lose so good a servant, and,
after all, though you can train a Filipino to
understand your ways, it is no more possible to
alter his being a Filipino by your theories than
to wash his skin white with somebody’s soap.</p>

<p>I was so interested in watching the marvellously
nimble way the sailors ran out upon the
outriggers, first to one side, then we made a
wide tack and the sail swung round, nearly
knocking our heads off, and the crew rushed
over to the other side, doing feats of balancing
far more wonderful than anything I ever saw
in a circus, for they had not got a nice safe net
below them, with a lot of men in brass buttons
holding on to the poles and looking up to see
if they made a slip. On the contrary, there was
nothing but their astounding balance and agility
between them, and fathoms of choppy sea running
with a swift current, and full of sharks.</p>

<p>They brought the boat to the beach at the end
of the street which runs at right angles from our
own, opposite the end of our house, and ran her
broadside on in shallow water and then up on to
the sand, where we could jump ashore from the
bows.</p>

<p>The sailors and the cook and Sotero carried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
gear up into the house, and when I went into the
hall, I had the impression of having been some weeks
in a strange country, whereas we had really only
been within sight of our own town from Saturday
to Monday. So many new things—and yet, though I
have written till I am tired, I feel that I have not
told you half what we saw and noticed.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_28">LETTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A LITTLE EARTHQUAKE, AND AN OPERA COMPANY
UNDER DIFFICULTIES</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>May 15, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We had a slight earthquake here on Wednesday
morning, the 11th. It was my first experience
of that form of excitement, and I am sure I don’t
want another. The queer thing that everyone here
tells me, and they have plenty of experience to go
by, is that people do not usually think much of their
first earthquake, but instead of becoming accustomed
to them, they become more alarmed, and get to be
horribly frightened at the mere suggestion of the
earth’s surface shifting about.</p>

<p>This one took place at about half-past four in the
morning, and at first I thought it was a burglar or
someone moving about the room, and was just
going to call to C—— when he cried out: “Wake
up! There is an earthquake!”</p>

<p>I woke up pretty quickly when I heard that!
The shaking continued quite a long time, and I
thought it a sickening sensation, and so horribly
uncanny, with all the room trembling, and the
furniture rattling and moving, while outside the
air was deathly still. I think that what made the
stillness was that no cocks crowed, and the eternal
shrilling of the crickets ceased, which made a deadness
in the ears such as one feels on coming out of
a factory.</p>

<p>C—— invited me to go out on the balcony and
“see the street moving,” which I firmly refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
do. I am sorry now that I did not go on to the
balcony, but at the time I felt too horribly frightened
to move hand or foot.</p>

<p>I don’t think I like earthquakes, but I expect I
shall have to accustom myself to them, for they are
so common in the Philippines as to excite no remark
unless some building tumbles down; and the houses,
as I think I told you, are built with a view to these
hysterics of old mother Earth, with all the planks
and beams tied with bands of <i lang="es">bejuco</i> to give them
room to shift a little.</p>

<p>But besides the earthquake, we have been in
more imminent danger since I last wrote, in the
shape of the final and really conclusive and farewell
performance of the Italian Quartette, which took
place last Saturday night. The theatre was very
full, and gaily decorated with loops of green leaves
and paper roses of red and yellow, mixed up with
perilous paper lanterns. The electric light, which
has been weak for some time, chose, on this occasion,
to go out altogether—in the midst of an impassioned
duet.</p>

<p>There was instantly great excitement, for the
paper lanterns were not lighted, and the theatre
was plunged in blackness of the deepest dye.
Reckless scratching of matches sounded all round,
and the little lights were held up for a few seconds
till they burnt out, and then dropped just anywhere.
One did not need to look to gather that a Filipino
did this thing! It made one’s blood run cold to
see them.</p>

<p>Of course, though the electric light was in such
a precarious state, and expected to expire at any
minute, there had been no provision made in case
of accidents, and the remedy now was a wild rush
outside to buy candles, which were soon produced
and stuck in dabs of their own grease along the
front of the stage and amongst the orchestra. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
or two lamps came somehow from somewhere and
were placed jauntily about the building, while the
spare candles were secured by enterprising spirits
in the audience and put about so that they shone in
the eye, and no one could see anything, and little
brown ladies in <i lang="es">camisas</i>, with huge gauze sleeves,
leaned past the naked lights with admirable
indifference. There was not a single accident,
however, but how that was managed, and indeed
how the whole matchbox theatre was not burnt to
the ground and the audience roasted, is simply the
eighth wonder of the world.</p>

<p>I can’t say I took the affair very cheerfully myself;
in fact, to be truthful, the sensation of impending
doom, and the trouble of having to keep my eye on
the wobbling candles, spoilt my enjoyment a good
deal. The singing was very good, and in spite of
the partial gloom, the opening scene of La Bohême
was given very well indeed, and it was such a treat
to hear that glorious music. Of course the darkness
suited that very well, and made the scene in the
garret most realistic, though I expect the Quartier
Latin was rather <i lang="fr">caviare</i> to the ladies in the muslin
<i lang="es">camisas</i>. I loved to hear the Italian too, it sounded
so full and round and pure after Spanish. I suppose
one prefers whichever tongue one happens to learn
first. After the opening piece the light suddenly
went up, so we had a fairly good sight of the
second part. They did a sort of shortening-up—I
can think of no other name for it—of Cavalleria,
acting really so remarkably well that the worn old
story seemed as fresh and terrible as if it were
just happening. I’ve never seen it done better in
any part of the world—no, not even Caruso and
Melba. One felt the full tragedy and pathos of
the music, and the duet between Turiddú, and
Santuzza, a handsome, graceful woman, was magnificently
impassioned, leading up to an almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
breathless moment when he cast the girl from him,
and she fell upon the ground.</p>

<p>But, alas!—we were in the presence of a
Filipino audience, who greeted the fall of Santuzza
with hearty laughter, and continued to giggle while
the girl sang her curse as she dragged herself to
her knees.</p>

<p>I don’t know how the Italians went on acting
as they did. I am afraid I should have lost my
temper and had the curtain lowered.</p>

<p>This great heat still continues, and is very
exhausting, for the lightest clothes are always
soaked, and the face and hands covered with little
beads. No one thinks less of a “perfect lady” in
this country if she mops her face with her handkerchief;
in fact, it is the only thing for the poor
creature to do. I simply long to feel fresh and
energetic, and to be able to walk fast on a hard
road on a cold day—what a dream of bliss! Even
to enjoy food would be a pleasant change.</p>

<p>Those who can get away, but they are very
few, go to Hong Kong, where the people are
making a fuss about their hot weather. It is
coolness after the Philippines. The missionaries
are the best off, with their nice little trips to
Japan; and there has been a great exodus of
these good people lately.</p>

<p>The lowest average of the thermometer is 93°,
which means that is sometimes as low as 90° but
generally up to 95°. Some people tell me this
is the usual thing at this time of year, and
others vow it is abnormal. Whatever it is, it has
gone on now for three months, and I am getting
rather tired of it, and don’t think I shall be able
to pull through another year out here. It is not
only the climate that tells on one, but the scarcity
and badness of the food. To think that you at
home in an average of 60° think you would die off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
unless you had fresh cabbages, and peas, and beans,
and gooseberries, currants, the first strawberries—how
the very names make one’s mouth water!
Well, they say the Monsoon will change soon, and
then the rainy season begins and the air gets cooler,
and that is something to look forward to. The wind
blows now some days from one side and some days
from another, in an undecided fashion, with
intervals of stifling calm, and then a sudden burst,
which whips the sunblinds from their anchorage.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_29">LETTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN EVENING ON THE RIVER—RIVAL BISHOPS</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>May 17, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We went out on the river one evening last week at
the invitation of two members of the boating club,
which has its being in a <i lang="es">nipa</i> hut on the bank above
the town, off the Molo road. It was a regular
little native hut, with a rickety ladder up to the
door, and boats slung underneath—a delightfully
primitive place.</p>

<p>We went out in a boat and a canoe, making
our way up-stream in the light of an exquisite sunset,
all bright-red gold behind the mountains, and
the river between its banks of low bushes like a
path of pink crystal. The air was deliciously cool,
or seemed so to us, and we rowed up a mile or
more before landing at the bank on the farther shore
from the town, where there were some fishing huts
in a grove of palms.</p>

<p>We beached the boats on the mudbank, and
then walked about through the trees till we came
to some huts, looking wonderfully picturesque in
the long stripes of pink light and mauve shadows
amongst the tall trees. Here a number of half-naked
Filipinos were loafing about, very civil,
kindly people, and one was a very skinny old
woman, who took a deep and unbounded interest
in me, and asked all sorts of extraordinary questions
about me.</p>

<p>The cocoanut trees in the grove bore many
large green nuts in clusters at the top, like big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
green footballs, and as we were all rather thirsty,
we asked if the hut folk would get one down for
us to drink from.</p>

<p>With much politeness and amazing alacrity, one
of the younger men ran up a tree, putting his toes
in the notches in the bark, and not falling and
breaking his neck by yet another Philippine miracle.
He came down with a big green nut, such an
enormous thing—the same in proportion to a cocoanut
as we see them at home, as a green almond or
walnut is to the nut in a shop. We asked him to
open it for us, so he squatted down and chopped
very deftly with a sort of sword which they call a
<i lang="es">bolo</i>, and I fancy I may have mentioned it to you
before. These <i lang="es">bolos</i> are a variety of the Malay <i>kris</i>,
and are made in all sorts of cruel shapes, often inlaid
very beautifully, but I believe the most frequent
form is simply that of a short, thick, curved sword,
which they use with deadly effect in fighting, and
with great skill in almost every other event in life.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The little brown people stood round and looked
at us while we watched the man with the <i lang="es">bolo</i>. He
chopped with marvellous dexterity, slicing off the
outer covering of soft green flesh, and then making
a hole in the top of the tender unripe nut inside.
The nut had a thin lining of transparent meat, and
was full of pale green liquid, like slightly soapy
water in appearance. This “milk” we drank out
of a small wooden bowl produced by the old
woman, a neat little vessel made out of half a
cocoanut, all in the most approved style of the
story books! The drink was refreshing enough,
but sweet and sickly. Then the man split the nut
open and made a clever little scoop with his <i lang="es">bolo</i>
out of a slice of bamboo which he picked up from
the ground, and with this he shaved off some long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
strips of the white meat, of which we ate a good
deal, but it was tough and tasteless.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus18">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Palm Grove.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_232"><i>To face page 232.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>So the opening of a green cocoanut was
the means of dispelling almost the last of my
illusions about a Tropic Island! I have so often
read about the nectar and ambrosia of the green
nut, and the wonderful yarns of travellers who say
there is no drink on earth like the green milk—one
book I remember went so far as to compare the
stuff favourably with lemonade! Perhaps it is all
right if you have been shipwrecked and your
mouth is full of sea water, but then I imagine so
few people who write the descriptions can ever
have had that advantage.</p>

<p>From the huts we went on till we came out
upon wide, open mud-flats, where there were a
great many salt pits, which fill with water when the
tide rises, for the sea water stretches right up to
this place and farther. The pits were surrounded
by pumps, after the fashion of the <i>shadoofs</i> on
the Nile, and wells and all sorts of curious contrivances
of bamboo, with long rows of pipes for
drying the salt—it is marvellous what these people
will do with bamboo. It was nearly dark by this
time, and the mud-flats looked very weird and
melancholy, the strange frames and poles appearing
ghostly in the dusk.</p>

<p>We came out upon the river bank again and
walked to the place where we had left the boats.
On the way I picked some sprays of small
pink blossoms which grow on big ragged bushes
with thorns, and look like May, and smell like
sweet currant. They look very pretty in a vase in
the <i lang="es">sala</i>, and are the only flower I have yet brought
home or had given to me, that has lasted for so
long as twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>C—— has been having more trouble with the
Customs, and this time over a boat he had to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
from Hong Kong, as such a thing is not made and
not to be had here. It is an ordinary boat for
going out to the ships, and cost 40 <i lang="es">pesos</i>, but when
C——, on being asked to value it, mentioned this
sum to the Customs authorities, they exclaimed
“Impossible!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately it happened that he could not
produce a bill for the boat, as he had got it through
an agent in Hong Kong, who charges it to his
account with the Firm in Manila, and he had not
even a bill of lading, as a friend had brought it
from Hong Kong for him. The Customs flatly
refused to take his word about the price, and sent
for some local sages to value the boat. One of
these worthies gave it as his opinion, off-hand, that
it was absurd to say you could buy a boat like
that for less than 60 <i lang="es">pesos</i>. Another said, “Probably
ninety.” A third, “Sixty at the lowest.”</p>

<p>So the authorities, like Solomon, struck the
happy medium, and charged C—— the duty (30
per cent.) on 80 <i lang="es">pesos</i>!!</p>

<p>And there is no redress, for the Firm’s accounts
will not be settled till the end of the month, or
even later, by which time the dues on the boat will
have been paid long ago, and when once a receipt is
given by the Government, no power but a special
Act of Congress can get one cent of it refunded.
Oh, and we know this to our cost! For, during all
these months, we have not ceased from appealing,
reappealing, and worrying tooth and nail about the
extra £40 we had to pay for our wedding presents.
I wish to goodness we had a “pull.” We should
get it back in a week.</p>

<p>The tariffs here seem to be put on in an incomprehensible
way. In a civilised old country it
might help trade if there were an import tax
against things the people could produce themselves,
but the system here works out quite differently, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
while a desire is being inculcated for things which the
natives cannot and never will be able to produce,
those articles are taxed at the same rate as they are
in the most highly developed country full of manufactories.
You will think I have become a regular
blue-stocking when you read these long discourses!
But you need not have any fears on that score, for
I am only trying to describe to you the conditions
under which we struggle for existence in one of
the most fertile countries in the world, and these
questions are of such vital and burning interest
that I hear them discussed by the most unlikely
and domesticated ladies!</p>

<p>What the newspapers call “Religious Circles”
have been in a great state of excitement lately, as
the Pope has sent a Cardinal Delegate to the
Philippines to rouse the Orthodox to a sense
of their peril from the <i lang="es">Iglesia Independiente</i>, the
Aglipayanos. When I was in Manila, this prelate
was there, an Irishman of the name of Agius. I
saw him and his suite at the Governor’s reception,
and people told me he was a very charming person.
Now he is touring about the Philippines, and this
week arrived here on a visit to the Bishop of
Panay—an American, whose name I forget.</p>

<p>There were great ceremonies and processions,
arches and welcomes on the arrival of the Cardinal.
But the Aglipayanos did not let the occasion pass
without comment, for they turned out in full force
with counter-processions and, it must be confessed,
with far larger crowds of followers.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday the Cardinal arrived
in great state. He drove off to Jaro, and the
road out to that town swarmed with priests,
and little carriages dashing about full of mysterious,
greasy-looking hangers-on in black coats
and bowlers, the like of which no human eye has
ever before seen this side of Suez.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day, yesterday, there was frantic excitement!
The Filipino Archbishop arrived! With no
official state, but greeted by an immense demonstration
of crowds of <i lang="es">Independientes</i>, who went out to
meet their pastor in decorated boats and launches,
with bands playing, Chinese crackers popping about,
and revolutionary marches with songs. He, also,
went to Jaro, under more triumphal arches, with
Welcomes, and one with his name, Monsignore
Hijaldo, in huge red letters all across it.</p>

<p>We drove out to Jaro in the evening to see
the fun, and were well rewarded, for the whole
Plaza was as good as a play—far better than
anything the Iloilo theatre could produce intentionally.</p>

<p>Jaro is a collection of rather fine old houses,
of the prevailing two-storied pattern, but large
and handsome, some of them with carved wooden
ornamentations and balconies with pretty pillars.
They stand round a very large green space, with
a bandstand in the middle, which is the Plaza.
At one side of the Plaza is the cathedral, a long,
ugly building, like a stone tunnel, and alongside
it is a smaller church, on much the same lines,
which is the Aglipayano place of worship.
Opposite the two, on the green Plaza, stands a
handsome old grey stone belfry, thrown out of the
perpendicular by earthquakes, and crumbling with
decay. At each corner of the upper story is a huge
white stone statue of a saint leaning forward with
some giant emblem clasped in his or her arms—such
a cumbersome, melancholy old edifice! We always
stop by the belfry, when we drive into Jaro, to let
the pony rest and crop the grass, which overflows
liberally into the road, and five times out of six
it happens that we are there when a small lamp
is swung up over the cathedral door, and a couple
of Filipino boys come across and go into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
belfry to ring the Angelus, which they do by
swinging themselves fearlessly about on the beams
of the big bells.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus19">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Cathedral and Belfry at Jaro.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_236"><i>To face page 236.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>When we drove out yesterday evening, we
first met landaus containing the Delegate and
the Bishop of Panay bowing and smiling to
right and left, and lifting up hands of benediction;
with many priests, secretaries, and retainers,
most of them very fat men with very white
faces.</p>

<p>Then, on the other side of the water, in the
suburb of La Paz, which is a big town in itself,
we met the Aglipayanos—Aglipay himself and his
followers—all brown, flat-faced Filipinos, dressed
something like the R.C. priests, only with fantastically
bent up hats, and driving in the native <i lang="es">quilezes</i>
or <i lang="es">calesas</i>.</p>

<p>In Jaro itself the fun was fast and furious,
for both the churches had a great display of
decorations outside—the <i lang="es">Independiente</i> considerably
embellished by a long covered way built out, of
latticed bamboo with palm-branches lashed to it,
and paper lanterns, and quantities of little flags.</p>

<p>Across the Plaza were the two houses, both
blazing with lights and flowers, the balconies
full of men in white suits and women in their
smartest dresses. In front of each house a band
was playing, as if no other music were within
a hundred miles, and the din was awful—the
constabulary brass band, which was serenading
the Papal Delegate, or his house, smashing and
braying Sousa Marches; while the Aglipayano
mandolines, guitars, and violins twiddled and
thumped steadily at “Hiawatha” and other
Filipino airs.</p>

<p>To anyone blessed with a glimmering of
humour you may imagine that the whole show
was a source of pure delight, and we lingered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
quite late, driving up and down in the hope that
there might be a speech or a row or something.
But apparently peace, if not goodwill, was the
motto, as, when we at last had to return home,
we left all hands as contented and jolly as if the
other fellows did not exist at all, or lived in
another continent.</p>

<p>You must imagine all this in heat such as you
have never felt, all the priests, devotees, and bandsmen
limp and dripping, and the faces of the
Filipinos like wet mahogany. We are in a chronic
state of discomfort, too, ourselves, which makes the
sight of the black and purple robes, the berettas,
and the outfit of the secretaries and hangers-on
a very tangible addition to our own discomfort.
I “guess” the “Dallergit” wishes the “call” had
“come right along” in the cool season!</p>

<p>I told you about the little love-birds which had
been presented to me, I think? “I had a dove,
and the sweet dove died” ... but my first lovebird
did not die of grieving, for I found him one
morning with a gash in his throat which looked
very like the work of a bad cat. When the wee
bird was dead and buried, the other little scrap did
not seem to mind much at first, but presently took
to having fits, and soon expired too.</p>

<p>I miss them very much, for they were dear little
creatures, and such companions to me, with their
sweet little chirping noises. People tell me it is
very difficult to keep birds at all out here, as
the little ants that swarm everywhere get under
their feathers and worry them to death in a few
hours.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_30">LETTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smaller">PHILIPPINE SANITATION—DECORATION DAY</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>May 29, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I know you will be glad to hear that we are having
a lull in the great heat, as the rain is beginning, or,
at any rate, the Monsoon is blowing through rain,
steadily from the S.-W., and the thermometer has
gone down from 95° to 90°, which makes a vast
difference to us, though it must still sound like
great heat to you.</p>

<p>I have just had a letter from a Manila friend,
who is spending the hot season at Benguet, whither
the “Gubernatorial party” and the Commissioners
have also fled; and where, according to the Manila
papers, I see they are having gay times ... lots of
Bridge. She says:—“We are very chilly people
up here, fires every evening, and hot-water bottles
at night! This is a lovely country, all pine-woods
and tree-ferns—a curious mixture. We ride about
here a very great deal, play cards, walk, and generally
have a thoroughly quiet, lovely time. I am going
to a euchre party this afternoon at a house near
by; there are to be very nice prizes, I hear. This
climate is like England. You and Mr Dauncey
would like it when he can get leave. There is a
sanatorium, hospital place here, where you can
go for one dollar, gold, a day per head. There is
also this house, but you could not live at that here,
at least I think not. I think this climate would do
most people as much good as going home. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
beautiful place, and they shortly expect a railway to
run within 15 miles of it, which will make it cheaper
to get here, and quicker; at present it takes three
days from Manila.”</p>

<p>That all sounds very tantalising to us sweltering
down here, but I <em>think</em> we shall wait till that mythical
railway is ready, for we have several times discussed
the pros and cons of a health trip to Benguet, but
when C—— went into the matter, he found that the
expenses from here and back would be more than
to go to England! And then, if we did go to this
paradise of pine-trees and hot-water bottles, we
should only be that much to the good, for we should
be still living on the awful Philippine food, and the
question is, should we get rid of that cuirass of
prickly heat? Also, would the water there still give
<i lang="es">sarna</i>—which I think they call in India “dhobey-itch”?
And these things being so, is it not better
to go home? And being at home, would it not be
the utmost folly ever to venture within a hundred
miles of a Philippine island again as long as life
lasts? I feel inclined to answer my own questions
by saying—American fashion—“That’s so!”</p>

<p>I missed my little love-birds so much that C——
got me some other pets, which we hope will flourish
better—three baby mongeese. They are the dearest
little things, so soft and gentle, and look like very
fluffy weasels, with large dark beady eyes and long,
busy, smelling-about noses. The people here call
them <i lang="es">Gato del Monte</i>, which is, being translated,
mountain-cat, though the animal we call by that
name is a very different creature. They are found
all over the islands, I believe, and there are many
in Guimaras, whence these were brought by a
countryman who was going round the offices trying
to sell them, with the little things nestled in his
coat. So C—— bought them for me for a couple
of <i lang="es">pesos</i>. They are very young and very tame, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
fact more than tame, for they run after me all over
the house, and as soon as I sit down, climb up and
sit on my shoulders, or curl up on my lap, and I
daresay the warmth of their woolly little bodies
would be grateful and comforting amongst the pines
and tree-ferns at Benguet! C—— has made them
a beautiful large cage out of a packing-case and
some wire-netting, where they spend their time
asleep in a box full of cotton wool, or else clamouring
to be let out, with a curious guggling, rippling
cry, a sort of cross between a nightingale’s “jug-jug”
and a cab-whistle.</p>

<p>Half the ground-floor of this house was let a
little time ago to a rabbit warren of low-class
Filipinos, who keep all sorts of animals in the rooms,
and throw all their refuse out into the narrow alley
between this and the next house. Unfortunately,
this is all on the side where our bedrooms are.
After a time we got accustomed to the mysterious
noises to a certain extent, though the bleating of
goats remained tiresome, and the person with consumption
who coughed all night still disturbed
us. The natives here die like flies of consumption,
and the dreadful cough, hollow cheeks, and
glittering eyes are a very common feature in the
landscape.</p>

<p>Well, we weathered through the noises, though
we were often inclined to shift our quarters to the
other side of the house, to the rooms which that
persistent American wished to inhabit. Fancy
breakfasting with them! I have not got over that
yet! But on that side, unfortunately, the construction
of the house is such that there is no through
draught, without which one cannot sleep. Finally,
however, the smell of the refuse gave C—— an
attack of tonsilitis, with a touch of fever, and as I
myself had also had some sore throats, we made
the move across, and found it was not so bad after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
all, for the S.-W. Monsoon blowing straight in kept
the air quite bearable.</p>

<p>The smells on the other side got worse and worse,
and we put bowls of disinfectant about, and complained
to the landlord of the house. He said he
had no power, meaning that he was really afraid
to offend and lose his tenants, but he “would speak
to the people,” advising us, at the same time, to go to
the Sanitary Inspector of the town, who would set
things right. Now, the municipality consists of
natives, and the Sanitary Inspector is a Filipino with
a Filipino’s notions of sanitation, so he can’t see
what we have to complain about, and we went on
sending in complaints and protests, which met with
vague replies at first, and latterly with none at all.
So at last C—— told the landlord that if he did
not have the alley cleared, we would leave the
house, whereupon <i lang="es">jornales</i> (labourers) were
promptly hired, and unimaginable arrears of
horrors dug out and removed—oh, the smell! And
as to future transgressions of the laws of cleanliness
and decency, C—— has adopted his own
method for that, which consists in the simple
plan of leaning out of the window when the
people below do anything he does not like, and
calling them “<i>Babuis</i>” (pigs), or “<i lang="es">sin verguenza</i>”
(without shame) in a very loud voice, which they
don’t like at all; and this method has more effect
than anything else, for he says: “You can always
‘get at’ a Filipino by making him ashamed of
himself.”</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_242"><i>To face page 242.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>We are lucky to be no worse off, however, for
it is a marvel to me how this town is not swept
clean of inhabitants by some awful plague, when
one thinks that it is absolutely without drainage or
sanitation of any sort, and when one sees and
smells the awful and ghastly rubbish heaps which
fester right amongst the houses in the town. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
only saving of the place is the Monsoons, and it is
no wonder everyone feels so ill and languid, even the
natives, as soon as the wind drops. There is a costly
School of Tropical Medicine in Manila, and many
learned articles appear in the papers from time to
time about germs and bacilli, and so on, assuring us
that, when the Filipinos know more mathematics
and Latin, they will know how to live more
healthily; but sound common-sense would seem to
lie in the direction of a strong and efficient sanitary
control of white experts and a few schoolma’ams
replaced by some paved and drained streets.</p>

<p>Oh, the streets! They are a disgrace to civilisation,
for I have never, no, not in Morocco, not in
little towns in the Canaries, known such neglect,
such dirt, such squalor, and such smells!</p>

<p>Grass grows at the sides of the streets, and in
wet weather many stagnant pools appear on pieces
of waste ground and between the houses, looking
very pretty indeed amongst the brilliant greenery
when the sun comes out again, with beautiful
reflections mirrored in their shallow depths, and
making little gems of scenes like bits out of a fairy
pantomime. All the same, one could quite willingly
sacrifice their beauty in the cause of health, and for
the sake of matter-of-fact drainage!</p>

<p>Mosquitoes breed in the swampy places in
which the native houses generally stand, and at
night the inhabitants frequently light fires under
their flimsy dwellings to dry the ground and destroy
the insects. At first sight these fires look very
strange and alarming; we often pass them as we
drive in the evenings, and it is yet another of the
local miracles to see the dry thatch huts not taking
fire from a pile of leaves and grass burning
underneath.</p>

<p>In connection with the swamps too, or I suppose
so, the Filipinos have another curious custom, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
is, as soon as anyone is taken ill, to shut the house
up tightly, with the screens let down and fastened
over the openings that serve as doors and windows,
and whenever you pass a house all dark and
hermetically sealed with tiny slits of light here and
there, you know some unfortunate soul is ill inside,
and in all probability dying, for the Filipinos have
no physique, and if they get seriously ill, they snuff out
like a taper. When a poor person is dying—really
at the point of death—he or she is taken out of bed
and carried to the priest to be assoiled, which
generally has the effect of killing the invalid outright.
Only two evenings ago we met one of these
melancholy little groups going along the Jaro road,
two of the men carrying a long bamboo pole on
their shoulders, with a canvas hammock slung to it,
and I think the poor woman, whose head was lolling
out, was dead already.</p>

<p>An American hospital, to which we have all
contributed by request, is being provided for the
town, and when we drive out, we often pass down
the road where this remarkable building is rising
slowly from a pile of beams and planks, all stacked
ready, and cut to certain lengths. I say it is remarkable
because the hospital has apparently been
designed in America by someone who has never
heard of the Philippines, for the main supports (the
<i lang="es">arigis</i>), instead of being made of great trees of hardwoods,
are quite slender posts of Oregon pine; and
the cross-beams and, in fact, all the timber work, are
of the same wood, which is about as much good
as so many pieces of cardboard against insects,
typhoons, earthquakes, and so forth. I daresay
these plagues do not prevail in the country where
this fantastic building was evolved.</p>

</div>

<p>But if the substructure of the hospital was the
laughing stock of the town, and the subject of many
rather acid jests on the part of those who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
contributed to such a monument of folly, you can
imagine what was thought and said when the wards
were seen in the making, and observed to consist of
screens of <i lang="es">nipa</i> and <i lang="es">bejuco</i> matting! All so hasty,
so shoddy, such a piece of blatant jobbery—but to
hear its advocates talk you would think the finest
hospital in Eu-<em>rope</em> was being rendered silly and
out of date!</p>

<p>To-morrow is Decoration Day, the anniversary
of the close of the war of the North and
South, when the graves of the soldiers who
fell in that struggle are decorated in the United
States.</p>

<p>Out here the day has also been established as a
public holiday; observed with bands and processions;
and they have so ordered the ceremony that the
graves of those who fell out here in the war with
Spain and the Insurrection are supposed to be
decorated, Americans and Filipinos alike. But the
two events become hopelessly confused in the
native mind; and it is no wonder that the Filipinos
have some dim idea that they are rejoicing over the
fall of those of the Americans whom they managed
to kill in the Insurrection. There are not many
American soldiers’ graves out here to decorate,
however, as the dead American warriors are being
dug up everywhere and sent back to their homes—such
a queer idea! Fancy if we dug up all the
men who fell in our innumerable wars and sent them
to their relations at home! There is nothing left
but bones, of course, but each man is identified by
a bottle containing his name, etc., which was buried
with him. At least, they are identified to a certain
extent; but a man who had the job of bringing a
lot of these defunct warriors down the Pasig for
shipment told C—— that the only thing to be done
as a rule was to put a name on a coffin and then
lay inside as many bones as you could find to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
a complete skeleton. It sounds rather horrible,
but I must say one can’t have much sympathy
with such unheroic and superstitious sentimentality,
which seems to me no better than the customs of
the Chinese.</p>

<span class="smaller">MR TAFT—TROPICAL SUNSETS—UNPLEASANT
NEIGHBOURS—FILIPINO LAW</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>June 5, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I don’t think I have yet mentioned to you the
great excitement in Manila, and in the Philippines
generally, which are convulsed by the wind of the
coming of Mr Taft, the Secretary of War in the
U.S.A., who, as I told you before, used to be
Governor out here. He is returning now to the
Philippines on a sort of tour of instruction for the
benefit of a party of Senators who, so say the
papers, have been opposed to Philippine interests
at Washington, owing to these interests clashing
with their own sugar plantations, mines, and
tobacco industries. Everyone seems to think this
expedition a very good idea, and it is going to be
gay and social as well, for a good many ladies—wives
and other relations of the Senators—are to
be included, and they say that the President’s
daughter, Miss Alice Roosevelt, may come too.
Some say that she will come for the trip, as a
pleasure party, and others declare that she is only
to be sent as a pawn and symbol of the President’s
goodwill towards Mr Taft and his schemes.</p>

<p>In the meantime the papers are full of personal
descriptions and puffs preliminary of the members
of this party, but by far the most popular figure
seems to be that of the President’s daughter, about
whom we get columns of description and narrative.
She must be a very fascinating and charming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
lovely girl, for though she is only twenty, she has
refused numberless offers of marriage from all sorts
and conditions of men, including the “effete hand”
of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, he to whom our
Princess Margaret of Connaught is now engaged.
About this latter affair there is a very long account
copied from another American paper—I mean a
U.S.A. one, not a Manila paper—where it is said
that Miss Roosevelt had declined to be a princess
because she will not marry a man she does not
love. I think that is highly creditable to her, don’t
you? And such a fine example to some of her
countrywomen.</p>

<p>This last week has been sunny every morning,
and then clouded over in the afternoon, and generally
there is rain towards evening, so we cannot make
up our minds about our second trip to Nagaba,
which has been on the <i lang="fr">tapis</i> for some time. We
were going last week, but put it off for various
reasons till to-morrow. Now, however, the
weather looks so threatening that I doubt if we
shall go at all. We are not without compensations,
though, as the cool-looking grey skies are delicious,
and the nights almost cold, so that a sheet is
necessary, and sometimes even a blanket. In
spite of the lowness of the temperature, however,
I do not feel refreshed, as I had hoped to do, for
the S.-W. wind is very enervating and relaxing, and
everyone really feels more languid than in the heat.
This wind has unshipped our green sunblinds, as
it comes in great gusts, roaring and tossing in the
thick belt of high palms that fringes the beach in
the distance. The sound of the surf and the wind
in the palms is delightful to me, for it reminds me
of the pine-woods at home.</p>

<p>A few evenings ago we got into some real
country by leaving the trap on the Molo road and
walking along a path that led away through some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
tall brakes of bamboo. These clumps of bamboo
are very graceful and beautiful, and the outline of
their tapering stems and little flat leaves against
the sunset skies always reminds me of that
embroidered Japanese screen we have at home—by
which you are perhaps sitting as you read this!
We passed the bamboos and bushes by the roadside,
and came at once to big grass fields and palm-groves,
with ramshackle huts dotted about and
half-clad native—how well I can sympathise with
their prompt abandonment of the unnecessary
extras of the civilised wardrobe, and only wish it
were our fate out here to be able to wear one
garment in a palm-grove! We wandered about
there for a long time, up and down paths and
tracks, and enjoying wonderful glimpses of glades
and green vistas that were like impossible fairylands.
There was the pink and orange bloom of a
fine sunset, too, to add to the unearthly beauty of
the palm-groves, where we lingered a long time,
just admiring everything in sight, and smelling the
delicious freshness of the wet earth.</p>

<p>We are very anxious to go there some day and
try to get a few snap-shots, as a reminder of the
scenes, though nothing could reproduce the colour.
It is difficult to get enough light, as C—— is very
busy just now, and does not get home before six.
Eight to twelve and two to six—good long hours for
office-work in the tropics! Still, we manage sometimes
to get out before the daylight has quite gone,
as the days are getting longer, but then it is, of
course, too late to take the camera. That, by-the-bye,
is another illusion dispelled, for I am sure I
have always read and heard that the sun in these
latitudes sinks suddenly at the same moment all
the year round. I have already told you that I
have watched in vain for this phenomenon. I
don’t know what happens in other places, but since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the sun has come North here, the sunset has
gradually changed to quite half an hour later than
it was in December. In fact, it may be even later
than that, for I can read on the balcony for a long
time after tea before the light fades. Of course
the twilight is brief compared to the length of time
it lingers on at home, and I suppose it is sudden if
it is compared to a long summer evening in England,
but then you can think of our longest twilight as a
flash if you compare it with Greenland!</p>

<p>About a month ago the basement of the empty
house next door was taken by a typical Eurasian
family—such a crew! beginning with an old father
who goes about in a vest, slack, dirty trousers, and
blue socks; an old mother, vastly fat, in petticoat,
chemise, and slippers; some sons and daughters of
all ages, and their husbands and wives and children,
and two native servants. The basement they
occupy consists of three large rooms. From our
side windows we look right down into their
windows, and get many astounding glimpses of
their <i lang="fr">vie intime</i>, including fearful revelations of
<i lang="fr">déshabillé</i>, which are the delight of C——’s life.</p>

<p>This family, who are quite well known in Iloilo
Filipino and <i lang="es">Mestizo</i> society, and turn out great
swells at the band, sleep about on <i lang="es">petates</i> (mats) on
the floor, in native fashion, and some of their
notions of sanitation are indescribable. The old
father has a fearful voice, a loud, not-human
bellow of insanity, which echoes in our rooms
sometimes and quite frightens me, and C—— says
I should be still more alarmed if I could understand
the awful expressions he is using. They are
always having horrid rows amongst themselves, all
in slatternly rags in their filthy rooms—in the
streets they are well-dressed and well-behaved, in
true Eurasian fashion, all the world over. The sons
are in various employments, which would keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
whole family in comfort, if not in decency, but one
need hardly say that it all goes in <i lang="es">Monte</i> and
buying diamond rings.</p>

<p>About a week ago, just as we had finished
breakfast, there was a terrible hullabaloo coming
from the dovecote next door, and we said to each
other that they must be having a worse row than
usual; when we heard yells and loud voices, and
the old man bellowing out even worse words than
the awful things he shouts out when he wants salt,
or a cigarette, or a sock. We rushed to the side
of the house looking on their windows, but a hand
was pulling the shutters together, and the screams
and yells and oaths were terrible. So we ran out
on to the balcony in time to see one of the sons-in-law
shoot out of the house, as from a cannon,
yelling “<i lang="es">Policia! Policia!</i>” and go running up the
street to the police station at the corner. A
crowd began to collect at once in the street, while
heads appeared at every window, and the pandemonium
in the house became deafening.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a young woman in two garments
ran out sobbing, with her hair down; followed
a minute later by the fat old woman in her chemise
and petticoat, wringing her hands and moaning, and
running up and down, till someone caught hold of
her and led her away to a house up the street.
Then Juanita, the little native servant, with her
hair streaming, rushed out with the baby in her
arms; and the little girl of six came running in to
the people below us, terrified and white and
blubbering. Then another daughter—with a white,
handsome face like a Bouguereau Madonna—hurried
out, and after her a woman carrying clothes,
whereupon a polite native clerk stepped across
from an office and conducted her to the shelter of a
friendly house.</p>

<p>All this time the bellowing and voices in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
house went on undiminished, till the son-in-law
arrived with a trim blue linen-clad native policeman.
They went into the house together and shut the
shutters and closed the door, and the noise died
down, and the crowd outside melted away!</p>

<p>Nothing more happened all that day, and no
human eye saw the policeman come out again.
But next day we noticed that the old man was
living with the natives under us; and C—— made
some enquiries, whereupon they said, “The old
man is mad,” adding quite casually that he stuck
a knife into someone, so his family chucked him
out.</p>

<p>Well, so he lived there for a few days, with
the windows of the house next door all shuttered
so that he should not be able to see in, and every
now and then he roared out “Ramon y Ju—a—ni—ta—aa!”
or “Juanita y Raaaaa—mooooon!”
always the names of both servants, when the
two natives would go trembling to him, with
the children for him to play with!</p>

<p>This went on till yesterday, when there was
an afternoon of shouting and cursing and futile
advice, and the street blocked with <i lang="es">carabao</i>-carts,
and natives swarming in and out of the house
carrying furniture upside down, and trying to
force it into the carts broadside on. We hear
the reason and result of all this is that the old
man has moved, some say to Manila, others, to
the next street. I think the poor trembling old
fat wife must have gone too, as I have not seen
her about again since then. The house next
door has its windows open on this side again,
and there seem to be more people than ever
lying about there—they never <em>do</em> anything—and
Juanita-a-a-a still takes the babies out in a
large wicker washing-basket mounted on squeaking
wheels; and the young men and women look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
great swells at the bandstand on Sundays and
Thursdays.</p>

<p>I mentioned the way these people slept
on the floor. That is a curious Filipino habit,
but I daresay it is very nice and cool, and the
floor can’t be any harder than the Filipino bed.
The servants sleep about on mats, generally in
the hall of the house, but ours refuse to sleep
in this house, as they say it is haunted by the
spirit of a young Spaniard who died here when
it was occupied by the Spanish Consulate. So
they spread their mats on the Azotea, and
if I wake up thirsty and go out into the
hall for a glass of water, I see them through
the open door, lying asleep on their mats in
the moonlight, looking like pictures of the corpse
on the battlefield, out of the <cite>Graphic</cite>, and rather
weird and uncanny, with their clothes very white
in the moonlight, and their dark hands and faces
and dark bare feet; but on damp or cold (or
what we call cold!) nights they look still more
uncanny, rolled in blankets, and looking like
mummies.</p>

<p>A friend who was here the other day told me
an amusing instance of Filipino methods which
happened a few days ago. A policeman came
for his cook one morning, with a summons on
the part of the cook’s wife for assaulting her.
So off the cook went to the court, not the High
Courts where American dignity administers the
highest justice with his boots off and his feet,
with holes in his socks, on a table before him,
but the police court where a Filipino tries to
deal with small offences.</p>

<p>In the evening our friend noticed that his own
cook and not a substitute was in the house, so he
asked the man what had happened in the
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said the cook, “they fined me five dollars
and my wife five dollars too, and sent us away.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Mr —— “you beat her.”</p>

<p>“No one said I did not beat her. But they
fined us both, you see, so I was allowed to go
away again, free, in time to cook the <i lang="es">señor’s</i>
dinner.”</p>

<p>And you may think that sounds like a sentence
out of the <cite>Hunting of the Snark</cite>, but it is perfectly
clear logic to the Filipino mind, and all parties
seemed to think the most lucid and satisfying
law had been administered.</p>

<span class="smaller">OUR MONGEESE—A FIRE—THE NATIVE EDUCATION
QUESTION</span></h2>

<p class="right"><i>June 15, 1905.</i></p>

<p>You must forgive the writing of this letter being
rather bad, as I am ill in bed again, and likely to
remain there for some time, for I have developed
a tiresome complaint, which takes, so people tell
me, a long time to heal. It sounds very simple,
for what has happened is that the mosquito
bites, with which my feet are covered, have become
poisoned with something in the water, or the touch
of a fly, and I hobbled about for a long time in
great pain, being doctored and told to lie up, but I
would not consent to, as it is so dull, and the
warmth of lying even on a mat makes one’s prickly
heat unendurable. Now, however, I am forced to
give in, for I can’t walk across a room. An
American friend tells me she has had this malady,
and it extended all the way up her limbs, and she
suffered great pain, and was ill for months. I am
afraid this does not console me much, for I am a bad
patient, as I have never had anything the matter with
me before I came out here. The climate is certainly
trying, but some people seem to be able to weather
through it pretty well, though I have never met
anyone who is really what one would call robust.
Some become wrecks, as I apparently should do if
I stayed much longer. I can’t tell you how thankful
I am to think that there is a chance of going
home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Our dear little mongeese are flourishing. We
let them out of the cage nearly all day now, and
they go running and smelling about the house;
squeaking when they think they are lost, and then
I have to go and find them, when they crawl up me
as up a large tree, and go to sleep on the branches,
quite safe and happy. I think you would love them.
They have the sweetest little innocent faces I ever
saw, and such pluck and individuality, each with its
own little fads and manners. In India, I believe,
people keep mongeese to kill snakes; but here they
seem to be ready to pursue any and everything,
and the house evidently affords good hunting,
especially the space under the roof. I saw one of
the mongeese under my wardrobe the other day,
struggling with what looked like some dreadful
grey insides of a little animal, and I hauled her out,
thinking she had got hold of something that might
poison her. It was the mangled body of a house-lizard—horrible
sight! Then another of the little
creatures caught an immense spider yesterday, and
sat under the <i lang="es">sala</i> table tearing off the long hairy
legs, and then choking the body down in great
gulps—ugh!</p>

<p>One night last week I was awakened by a
police-whistle in the street, sounding an alarm,
which is one long note and two short ones. We
found this alarm note out in a rather curious fashion,
as one evening we whistled for one of the servants
like that—we were sitting on the balcony at the
time—and a few moments later a policeman knocked
at the door and wanted to know what murder or
other trouble we were in! And when C——
enquired about it at the police station, they asked
him not to blow a whistle in that way in the street
again unless we were in danger. It was a comfort
to know that the signal would work so well.</p>

<p>So when we heard the long note and two short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
ones in the night, we turned out on to the balcony,
whence we saw the glow of a big fire at the
end of the street towards the point, and Filipino
policemen were running along below with clanking
buckets.</p>

<p>The building that was on fire was the Military
<i lang="es">Corral</i> (stables), which made a fine blaze, and there
was a stirring scene when the poor frightened
horses came tearing down the quiet, dark street in a
maddened rout. They were the American horses,
which look so big and powerful and quite alarming
to eyes accustomed to the little Filipino ponies.
They clattered down the street in batches, tossing
their heads and trying to pass one another, with
the glow of the fire in the sky behind them, and we
heard the sound of their hoofs dying away and away
through the empty town. After a while the light
in the sky faded out, the policemen with their
buckets returned slowly, and we went back to bed;
but no one else in the street had so much as looked
out of a window!</p>

<p>We learned afterwards that many of the horses
were found wandering far out in the country, but I
believe some of them have not been caught even
yet. The <i lang="es">Corral</i> was burnt to the ground, as they
had to wait till the police arrived to put it out,
because there were only two soldiers sleeping there,
all the rest living in houses in the town and suburbs
with their <i lang="es">queridas</i> (native mistresses). This seems
a very strange state of affairs, but it is a well-known
fact, and on this particular occasion was referred to
quite casually by the soldier on duty (of whom
C—— was asking information), and who apparently
thought it was the most natural arrangement for
troops in a disaffected country.</p>

<p>I have been reading a great deal since I have
taken to bed, and besides all the home papers
you send me, I have the Manila papers and <cite>El<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Tiempo</cite> (Iloilo), which I find I can read quite
easily now. <cite>The Manila Times</cite> of June 10 had a
long article about the eternal education question,
headed “Arbitrary Race Distinctions,” in which, as
you may gather from the title, some American
works out his nation’s theory that there is no real
difference between East and West. The writer
very amiably wishes to point out that Filipino
children are just as intelligent at school as are
American children, and I think this is about the
hundredth article I have read to that effect; but I
have still to read or hear any observation to the
effect that precocity is the natural heritage of every
Oriental child. Americans always appear to judge
the Philippines by no standard, precedent, or
parallel; which I suppose is very natural for
anyone coming straight from such an absolutely
different country as the U.S.A. In this article,
of which I am speaking at present, there are many
long and fine words recklessly thrown about, such
as “introspection,” “collective individuality,” and
so forth, which I think are meant to prove that if a
Filipino child is precocious, he will grow up a clever,
cultured, and enlightened man or woman; whereas
every unprejudiced person knows that the Filipino
people learn with intelligence (an intelligence which
is, after all, only remarkable when compared to a
very ordinary white child) till they reach manhood
or womanhood, and then it is as though a veil
were drawn over the brightness of their minds,
and they not only progress no further, but even go
<em>backwards</em>!</p>

<p>This optimist also pictures a future “in three
generations,” when “the iron horse will spin
merrily up and down the passes,” by which I take it
he implies that means of communication will at last
(instead of at first) be established; and after a lot
of hyperbolical descriptions of machinery, he winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
up with this, “a sleek, well-nourished Filipino will
garner the grain and check the tree boles”—which
is very fine talk, but, to begin with, no one ever saw
a Filipino who was not sleek and well-nourished,
and what one wants to know is, what labourers will
toil at the “iron horse” and the machinery with
sufficient thrift and honesty to make those concerns
worth the attention of the American or even
Filipino capitalist? It is easy to imagine that some
day the natives of the Philippines may be allowed
to administer their own government and deal out
laws of life and death to each other, but where is
capital to come from? For the notion of Wall
Street putting money into a business run by a
Filipino, would be beyond the wildest dreams of
the most uninstructed voter in the remotest State.</p>

<p>Now, what I can’t make out is this, are all
these essays and writings and leaders about the
absolute equality of the Filipino mind with the best
white intellect really genuinely what the Americans
think of these people, or are they just so much dust
in the eyes of the native as well as the foreign critic
to excuse and justify the position the U.S.A. has
chosen to assume towards these Islands?</p>

<span class="smaller">A PAPER-CHASE—LACK OF SPORTS—PREPARATIONS
FOR MR TAFT</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>June 26, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>C—— and another man got up a paper-chase last
Sunday, and, by way of being cordial, advertised
the event in <cite>El Tiempo</cite> a day or two before, C——
and his friend arranging to be the hares, and let all
Iloilo chase them, if it cared to. They were very
keen and excited about their venture, which was
something quite new in the way of local enterprise.
The “meet” was in Plaza Libertad at six in the
morning, and when they got there and found a
large company of Spaniards, <i lang="es">Mestizos</i>, Swiss, and
one or two other Englishmen, they were delighted,
and set off in great feather. Our pony is a very
good “goer,” and can fly along ahead of almost any
other pony here, so C—— and his friend started
and tore along the Jaro road in the cool morning,
with the “field” after them.</p>

<p>Beyond Jaro, where they were out in the open
country, they noticed that the hunt was far out of
sight and hearing, so they ambushed in some
bamboo brake, and hung about, peeping round
bushes for about a quarter of an hour, and then
went cautiously back a few yards and hung about
again, and so on till by degrees they got back into
Jaro. Imagine their disgust when they at last
tracked the other sportsmen to a bar where they
were sitting at little tables drinking cold beer!
Their fury about the incident is comical, but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
cannot help sympathising with them after all the
trouble they took to infuse a little sport into the place.</p>

<p>One of the chief things Cebú crows about is
possessing a race-course and a Jockey Club, and
I think they are quite right so to crow, as something
of the sort would be a boon here. One
need hardly say that when anything like that is
done in Manila or anywhere else, the Americans
have no part in the initiative, as they are not a very
sporting people, and all they do to keep themselves
alive is base-ball. It seems so odd to be in a
garrison town, and not see officers with sports or a
club, or polo or gymkhanas or anything. The
Filipinos have no games, and the great idea is to
teach them base-ball, which, by-the-bye, the
Americans call ball-game. When I say the
Filipinos have no games, I forget a sort of ball they
throw about, in the streets or anywhere, made of
strips of bamboo bent into a hollow, spherical
frame; but the throwing about is not conducted
on any principle or according to any rules.</p>

<p>When I am feeling well again, I should like to
ride in the mornings, but I wish I had brought my
saddle, as there is not such a thing as a side-saddle
to be bought in Iloilo, or, the shopkeepers tell us,
in the whole Islands. This is because the <i lang="es">Mestizas</i>
never ride at all, and the American women ride
astride in large loose trousers that look like two
skirts.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There are very few here who ride, but I
saw several going about in Manila, and am confirmed
once and for ever to my allegiance to the
side-saddle, for a more hideous and ungainly effect
than women astride I never saw, to say nothing of
its vulgarity. The attitude also brings out all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
disproportions of the female figure, making it
look top-heavy and ill-balanced. It is all very
well for the Amazons to look well on a Greek
sarcophagus, but no modern woman of over sixteen
is shaped like that—and I very much doubt if the
ordinary ancients were either, quite apart from
corsets, boots, and collars. Besides all that, from
the point of view of sense, a woman’s knees can’t
be strong enough to grip the saddle. So as I
have not brought my own saddle I shall not be
able to ride, and now we are thinking of going
home, it is not worth while to send for it.</p>

<p>I read in my Manila papers that there is a
fearful row going on in Manila now, because the
committee who are arranging the banquets and
receptions for Mr Taft and his party have invited
heads of every religious sect except the Iglesia
Filipina, and the latter are making a terrible fuss,
and insisting on Father Aglipay being included
amongst the official guests. Of course, if he
is asked, the R.C. won’t come, and the Pope
will be furious, and the Insurrectionist Party will
score one important point in the public eye.
On the other hand, if the authorities fall out
with Aglipay, they fall foul of his powerful
following, who give quite enough trouble as it
is, so they are in a very uncomfortable cleft stick,
besides the fact of partizanship for any one religion
being entirely unconstitutional. And the trouble
is aggravated, you see, by Mr Taft being such an
ardent pro-Filipino, and all the natives believing
that his advent is to be a sort of second coming
to announce the millennium of freedom.</p>

<p>What he <em>is</em> coming for, besides the personal
conducting of the anti-Filipino Senators, is a staple
subject of conversation, many thinking he will be
allowed to announce a great reduction in taxation
as a sort of halo to his visit. Whatever it is, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
so anxious not to miss his visit, and I do hope our
return journey will not have to begin before he
and his party arrive.</p>

<p>Besides the Taft excitement, Manila has been
convulsed for months by efforts to get fireworks
from America for “the 4th.” Already in the
month of April there were huge “scare-heads,”
as they call them, in the papers, with letters big
enough for a poster, beginning</p>

<p class="center">FIREWORKS NOT GONE OFF YET,</p>

<p class="noindent">and then another headline to the effect that</p>

<p class="center">THEY WILL NOT REACH MANILA TILL JUNE.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes these headlines are very comical, whether
intentionally or not I don’t know—for instance,
when the transport <i>Sherman</i> left, there was a headline
in enormous letters,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Sherman’s</i> <span class="smcapuc">LIVING FREIGHT</span>,</p>

<p class="noindent">which I at first took to mean cows or horses, but
found to my surprise it was only a list of officers’
names.</p>

<p>I am sure you will be sorry to hear that
one of our dear little mongeese is dead, the little
man of the party. He was very sick for a day or
two, lying on the floor on his stomach as if in
pain, and when the others came running into my
room in the morning, he could only crawl very
slowly after them. At last, at about ten in the
morning, he died, poor, gentle little beast, and I
made Domingo take him out and bury him in the
garden. We don’t know what he died of, but we
think it was tough cockroach, as his poor little
throat was full of hard brown wings, which we
hauled out, but it did him no good to get rid of
them. What I fear is he may have picked up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
cockroach which had died of rat-poison. I gave
him weak sherry and water to revive him, but he
brought it all up again with pitiful little groans
and squeaks, and soon afterwards he died.</p>

<p>The little widows did not seem to mind much,
they hopped about as usual; but now one of them
has injured an eye in some way, and has gone
blind in it, and is very sick and sorry, and I am
afraid she won’t live long either. I bathed the
poor eye with cold tea, which gave the little
creature some relief, for she lifted the lid slowly,
and then I saw that the eye had a cut right across,
as if some animal had scratched it. She can only
move very slowly, with her head on one side—a
very sad sight—just able to crawl as far as
wherever I am, and then sit in a heap waiting to
be lifted up, when she goes to sleep on my lap,
and lies still for hours.</p>

<span class="smaller">TRYING HEAT—AN AMERICAN PROSPECTOR—NEW
LODGERS—BARGAINING FOR <i lang="es">PIÑA</i></span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>June 29, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>The weather is becoming more stormy, and
typhoons are signalled, but so far they seem to go
wide of us, which is a very good thing. The
thermometer the last few days has been very low,
78° to 80°, but the damp makes it more trying and
relaxing than when we had over 90° to contend
against. With the rain, all sorts of trees have
come into bloom—things with coarse, strong foliage
and huge bright flowers. The fields are all
covered with very vivid green grass and corn
coming up, and sometimes when there is a purple
thunder-cloud across half the sky and all these
colours in the sun, wet with rain, shining against
it, the effect is simply like a scene cut out of
glittering metals.</p>

<p>As I explained to you when we first arrived,
life here is adapted to dry heat, and the fears I had
then about the wet season are being justified every
day, for steel and silver rust while you look at
them; clothes come out in feverish patches of
blue mould; silk and satin “go” so that they tear
like tissue paper; and all sorts of mysterious
“beasts” are stowed away in our garments, while
shoes have to be shaken before putting on more
carefully than ever.</p>

<p>C—— amused me the other day with an
account of an American millionaire who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
down by the last boat from Manila to “prospect”
in this island and Negros for sugar. It seems
that the fancy of this plutocrat, who is quite a
common, roughly-dressed old man, is to buy up
half the island, with which object he went to the
office, as C——’s firm are the largest, if not the
only exporters of sugar in these islands. C——
said the old chap’s notions filled everyone with
amusement, for he wants to get control of some
plantations, and put up sugar mills that will
crush 10,000 tons of cane daily! The price and
scarcity of labour were represented to him as a
factor in his schemes, as well as the Export Tax,
lack of roads, and other trifles. But he was not
much depressed, and I daresay he will tackle the
enterprise in the American sink or swim style, which
seems rather a pity, as what the Philippines want
is small and prosperous farms—not huge trust-like
businesses to produce vast sums to be spent in New
York or Paris.</p>

<p>You remember my telling you about the <i lang="fr">fracas</i>
next door? That family all moved away, eventually,
but not to Manila, only to the next street parallel to
this. The next-door basement is now occupied by
a dressmaker, a jolly fat old Tagalo woman with
a deep voice like a man, and her hair scraped
up into a knob with a comb (an ordinary white
bone one for <em>combing</em>) stuck across it. Besides
the comb, she wears nothing but a chemise,
petticoat, and slippers. The work-girls are all
natives, and they sit about the big front room
on mats on the floor, sewing and cutting out and
talking all day long. They are there at five in the
morning, and often work till after dark. Two
have sewing machines on tables, and they look
so queer in their tight native <i lang="es">sarong</i> and muslin
<i lang="es">camisa</i>, sitting on a Viennese cane chair at a
treadle-machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The husband of the Tagalo is a fat, greasy
Spaniard, with side-whiskers, and an eternal cigar,
who lounges all day in a cane chair in vest and
trousers, reading the <cite>Heraldo</cite>, and balancing his
slippers on the tips of his bare toes. They appear
to hit it off very well, he and his old native wife,
for he is quite content to blowze and loaf all day,
and roll off to his club now and then, while she
is a typical, thrifty, hard-working Tagalo,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> always
amongst her work-girls, and generally sewing
herself. She sits in a chair, though, and every
now and then picks up an old cigar-box that is
for ever within her reach, and rolls herself a
cigarette, scooping up very carefully every crumb
of tobacco that falls into her capacious lap.</p>

<p>This Filipina keeps the house much cleaner
than the <i lang="es">Mestizas</i> did, and has more regard for
privacy, in the shape of curtains of bright cretonne
nailed across the side windows. The old lady
has a very pet dog, which is exactly like herself—a
huge, fat, sleek, brown creature, perfectly good-natured,
with a deep, full voice. They have a
spaniel too, and other dogs that run in and out,
and I can’t make out how many belong to the
house, or how many are only friends; but I got
to be quite certain of one, which nearly always
lies on the window-ledge, and to know it by
sight. After a time, however, it gradually dawned
on me that this particular spaniel never moved—and
then I discovered that he was <em>stuffed</em>! Till
I knew that, he was, to me, a quiet, contemplative
dog; but since I found he was stuffed, he has
become a horrible, uncanny demon.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning a little old native woman
appeared wandering round the balcony with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
bundle under her arm. When she caught sight
of me she darted away, and in a few minutes
Sotero came into the <i lang="es">sala</i> saying that a <i lang="es">mujer</i> (a
woman) wanted to sell some <i lang="es">piña</i> to the <i lang="es">señora</i>.</p>

<p>I said I did not want <i lang="es">piña</i> particularly, but
that the woman could come and show it to me if
she liked; so in she came and squatted on her heels
in the doorway while she undid the bundle, first a
piece of cotton, and then an old newspaper, then
more cotton, and at last a lot of rolls of muslin.
They were very pretty pieces of stuff, dyed in
pale greens, pinks, blues, and mauves, but she
wanted sixteen or eighteen <i lang="es">pesos</i> apiece (thirty-two
to thirty-eight shillings) for them—dress lengths of
fifteen narrow yards. I said: “I will give you
nine <i lang="es">pesos</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Santa Maria!</i>” she threw up her hands. “I
could not live. My mistress would beat me!”</p>

<p>I said that was nonsense, because she knew
no Filipino lady would dream of giving her more
than seven.</p>

<p>“Fourteen at the very lowest, <i lang="es">señora</i>, and the
American ladies gave me eighteen without any
questions.”</p>

<p>“That is very silly of them,” I said. But I
knew it to be true, for I had been present at a
great buying of <i lang="es">piña</i> by American tourists, and
the prices they gave were simply idiotic.</p>

<p>“I am not <i lang="es">Americana</i>,” I said.</p>

<p>“I know that” (I daresay she did, for on that
point a native rarely, if ever, makes a mistake), “so
I would not think of asking the <i lang="es">señora</i> more than
thirteen, which I hope she will not mention to
anyone.”</p>

<p>“Why should I pay thirteen for stuff that I
know is to be had in the Filipino houses for nine?”</p>

<p>“If I say twelve, may the <i lang="es">señora</i> say a prayer
that I may not be dismissed by my mistress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am <i lang="es">Protestante</i>. I think each person must
say their own prayers.”</p>

<p>“The <i lang="es">señora</i> is wise and good. She will give
me eleven and a half.”</p>

<p>And so on, and so on. Before we had done,
I was the kindest, wisest, most humane, and
beautiful and polite woman the sun ever shone
on; I was blessed by all the Saints in turn—but
I paid nine <i lang="es">pesos</i> for a roll of blue <i lang="es">piña</i>, and the
old woman said she would come any day and
sell me any amount more at the same price.</p>

<span class="smaller">DECLARATION DAY—THE CULT OF THE FLAG—A
PROCESSION, FESTIVITIES, AND A BALL</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>July 4</i>.</p>

<p>This is a tremendous day here, and a universal public
holiday—Declaration Day, you know; the anniversary
of the day when the States declared themselves
independent of the Mother Country. All
the town is gay with palm-branches and myriads of
Stars and Stripes, while the fun began at sunrise
this morning by a great letting-off of Chinese
crackers, and Americans coming out on their
balconies in pyjamas and firing pistols into the air.</p>

<p>I think the Americans must be a very patriotic
people, for out here they keep up these anniversaries
with even more fervour, I am told, than they do at
home, where they are a tradition of the soil. The
cult of the national flag, too, is a perfect passion
with them, and I have yet to see an American
house out here where the Stars and Stripes do not
appear in some part or other. In very many
houses the flag is used as window-curtains, as
ceiling-draperies, as <i lang="fr">portières</i>, as tablecloths,
besides little extra sort of Christmas-cake flags
being stuck about wherever an ornament is wanted.
One does not see this sort of thing in colonies of
other countries, but the American flag devotion is
really so sincere that one cannot cavil at its excess.
Nevertheless we should consider it odd if the houses
of high officials, and of everyone, in fact, in one of
our colonies were decorated with Union Jacks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
this fashion! Of course the Spaniards laugh at
it very much; but then they are, very naturally,
rather critical of all things American. One of them
was holding forth bitterly to me on this flag question
a day or two ago, and when I said that I thought
it very nice to see so much patriotic feeling, he
waved his hands and replied, very hotly: “It is
not patriotism! It is farce! We, who have been
born and bred for hundreds of generations on our
native soil and love our country as a mother—we
hold our flag sacred! We do not use it as
furniture!”</p>

<p>I was much amused at his vehemence, but did
not dare to smile for fear of hurting his feelings.
Instead, I tried to soothe him down by saying that
I thought the flag cult was perhaps a benefit as a
direct appeal to the elementary natures of the
Filipinos. This move of mine was a failure,
however, for he burst out with renewed fury:
“The Filipinos! What they think of it! Ha!
You should hear them!” So I gave him up as a
bad job!</p>

<p>To get back to the Declaration Day. The
popping of pistols and throwing of crackers into the
streets went on intermittently till about eight
o’clock, when a procession began marching about the
town, and luckily the day is extremely fine, though
it is very hot indeed, as, though the thermometer is
as low as 84°, there is not a breath of wind stirring,
and all nature is very still and bright and shining.</p>

<p>The procession began to pass our house at
about nine, so we had no more trouble to see it
than just to lean over the balcony with some
friends who had come round to profit by our
position. C—— tried to get some snap-shots, but
I am afraid they may not come out very well, as the
camera is damp, like everything else in the house,
and has a good coating of the prevailing blue mould.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The first spectacle that came along was a number
of American officers on horseback, in khaki, with
sashes of any colour they seemed to fancy—pale
blue, pink, scarlet—slung round one shoulder and
tied in a large bow on the hip. They rode the big
army horses, which are no larger than ordinary
horses at home; but, as I told you before, they look
like pantomime animals after one’s eye is used to
the Filipino ponies.</p>

<p>There was some hitch, out of sight, as the procession
reached us, and all the officers pulled up
their horses and turned round to look back. I don’t
know what it was, but they halted a long time, trying
all the time to get into the shade of the houses, for the
heat was already very great. The men’s khaki suits
were dark with perspiration, quite a different colour!
Their horses dripped puddles of sweat when they
halted, and one white horse was gradually turning
<em>purple</em>!</p>

<p>The Americans rode in the style which I notice
they all adopt. It does not look well according to
our ideas, for they slouch in the saddle and flap
their elbows, sitting with their legs sticking out
straight as if the horse had tar or something on its
ribs which the rider wanted to keep clear of.
They seem to hold their reins in any sort of way, in
each hand and up to their chins being the favourite
method, which looks awkward, to say the least of
it. After them came one or two Filipinos, who all
ride very well by instinct, sitting their horses firmly
and gracefully, with flat thighs, and moving as if
they were part of their mount, so that it is a
pleasure to look at them. The little ponies and
horses of the Filipinos pranced and curvetted about
in a most engaging manner, which desirable result
is brought about by means of an ingenious contrivance,
borrowed from the Spaniards, of a sharp iron
spike which runs into the roof of the horse’s mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
when the rein is pulled, causing the animal to fret
and foam and sidle to the admiration of beholders,
who wonder how the rider can be so brave and
cool with such a spirited steed.</p>

<p>After this little cavalcade had got past, the procession
proper came along, headed by a military
band from Guimaras, playing extremely well, and a
long column of American soldiers, all in khaki and
wearing khaki felt sombreros, such as our troops
adopted in the Boer War, turned up at one side
and with a narrow blue cord knotted in front, the
ends finished off with two small blue acorns. They
marched very well, all looking as exactly alike as
so many toy soldiers on an expanding frame—you
know the things? All very tall men, with
long, handsome faces, narrow shoulders, and long,
thin legs, not at all a robust type, no wiriness and
no depth about them.</p>

<p>After the soldiers came a dozen or so of ordinary
civilians in white linen suits and <i lang="es">sombreros</i>, with
stars and medals on their breasts. They were
followed by a similar group of men on foot, and
these two little bands represented the Veteran
Army of the Philippines, which includes anyone who
volunteered in any capacity during the War. We
told C—— he ought to be in that company, or at
least to have a medal, as he was once made a
temporary “<em>loo</em>tenant,” and fought for the Americans
in Samar. I think, however, that the V.A.P.,
as they call it, confines itself to American volunteers.
With the American craze for societies and so forth,
the V.A.P. are a sort of brotherhood, and have
lodges and badges and meetings, and all that sort
of thing. They gave a dance when we first came
here, to which we went, and were awfully disgusted
when we arrived to find that we had come too late
for a solemn Lodge Meeting at which some ceremony
had been performed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>After the V.A.P. came a lot of Philippine
Scouts, quite the opposite build to the American
soldiers, as they were very small, square men, with
brown, square faces, high shoulders, long bodies,
and short legs. Sturdy-looking little people, and
looking very trim and smart in their neat khaki
uniforms. Their band followed them, and behind
that came the Constabulary, more little square
“brown brothers” in white gala suits, with <em>their</em>
band.</p>

<p>A string of carriages came next, decorated,
wheels and all, with Stars-and-Stripes flags and
filled with all sorts of Americans, Filipinos,
<i lang="es">Mestizos</i>, and Spaniards, men and women, a very
gay crowd. Following them was the Fire Brigade,
consisting of natives marching on each side of an
old hand-pump, like a thing on a sailing ship, and
carrying a most amusing banner, painted with a
picture of a house on fire, where a man in the
middle distance worked a hose with a Niagara
pouring out of it, while in the foreground a huge
woman holding a giant baby sat on a packing case
amongst a lot of very small furniture.</p>

<p>Next came a Filipino Base-ball Team, in khaki
knickerbockers and black shirts, with <span class="smcapuc">ATLETICA</span>
in large white letters across their chests, after the
fashion of that base-ball team we once saw play in
the gardens of the Borghese.</p>

<p>The great feature of the procession was a large
car decorated with a quantity of American flags and
portraits of Washington, surmounted by a big
pasteboard column, striped red and white, on the
top of which lay a scroll of paper, held down by a
gigantic gilt ink-pot with a mammoth quill stuck in
it, and on the scroll was written <span class="smcapuc">CONSTITUTION</span> in
big letters.</p>

<p>All the men in the Port Works went past, some
carrying hammers, and some bearing, between five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
six of them, immense long boring-rods for blasting.
They were Filipinos, of course; in fact, with the
exception of the American soldiers and a dozen or
so of the occupants of the carriages, the whole
procession was Filipino—all quite pleased and
childlike to march about with banners to Sousa’s
stirring tunes. I don’t suppose one in twenty of
the “little brown brothers” had the vaguest idea
what their big white brothers were so rejoicing
about; or if they had ever heard of Townshend
and the Stamp Duties they would think the
commemoration of the removal of a yoke of foreign
bad government and taxation was something to do
with their own everlasting struggle for independence.
Besides this comical side to the rejoicings, there
was the absurd anomaly that a great part of the
funds for this celebration had been contributed by
the British commercial houses!</p>

<p>Well, it was an interminable string of people.
The Normal Schools of Jaro, La Paz, Molo, etc.,
each under their own banner, a long file of boys
and then girls in all sorts of outfits and colours, but
the girls all wearing the Filipino <i lang="es">camisa</i>, and
many of them carrying the branches of artificial and
gilt flowers, which they use in religious processions.
It was particularly noticeable that there was no
priest of any sort in the procession, nor were the
priestly colleges or the Convent Schools represented
in any way.</p>

<p>We got quite tired of watching them at last,
especially as the whole thing kept on getting
muddled up and having to stop for long, weary
halts. We came to the conclusion at last that as
there was no crowd in the street or at the end of
it; there must be a tiger round the corner. But a
very literal Scotch friend said: “There are no
tigers in the Philippines.”</p>

<p>A dance was given by the Spanish Club last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
night, and there is to be another to-night, at the
invitation of the Presidente of the town, at his
official residence, the Gobierno. I am not well
enough to go to both, for I have not been out of
the house for weeks, and even now it is rash to
stand at all till my feet are healed, but I felt I must
go to one of these functions, so I have chosen
to-night, which is, according to Iloilo notions of
etiquette, far the less exclusive of the two, so it
will be much the more amusing.</p>

<p>I have been writing this, lying in my long
chair in the <i lang="es">sala</i>, while C—— went out to the
Plaza to see if he could hear any speeches or
anything funny. He has just come back, and tells
me there was a platform erected in the Plaza, where
speeches had been rolled off, but he had been too
late to hear any of them. A great pity, as I
daresay they may have been amusing, because one
of the speakers was a rabid pro-Filipino and the
other (both Americans) a keen pro-American. I
will finish this letter to-morrow, so as to be able to
tell you all about the ball.</p>

<p class="right"><i>July 5.</i></p>

<p>We went for a drive yesterday, late in the
afternoon, and when we got as far as the Plaza, we
found a terrific <i lang="es">Fiesta</i> in progress—all the lamp-posts
decorated with Stars and Stripes and Japanese
lanterns; and a huge stage, covered with palms
and more Stars and Stripes, put up opposite the
bandstand, and full of Americans, while vast
crowds of Filipinos surged below—the men in
white and the women in colours like those in a
cheap church window—and it all looked very gay and
pretty. I was very much surprised to see all this,
as I had had no idea anything of the sort was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
in contemplation, and I was sorry that neither I
nor the other Englishwoman had been invited to
the stand, but I suppose they thought we would
not care to take part in rejoicings over the
Declaration of Independence although our countrymen
had contributed, by request, a great part of the
funds for the celebration.</p>

<p>We pulled up and looked on for a little while,
much interested in a tug of war which was
unlike anything we had ever seen. The two sides,
Filipinos, stood on a long wooden frame like a
gigantic ladder lying on the ground, and on this
they lay at opposite ends, with their purchase on
the rungs, and pulled at the rope with no effect
whatever to the amateur eye; but apparently
some man in command thought otherwise, for a
voice suddenly sang out that one side had won,
whereupon the competitors all let go the rope
and fell quite limp, and then got up and walked
away.</p>

<p>They had races, too, and a greasy pole—no,
two greasy poles—of bamboo, with a packet of
money at the top, and, of course, a flag of Stars
and Stripes. Up these the enterprising native
youth of Iloilo swarmed, to the intense joy of the
onlookers, who howled and roared with appreciation.
All sorts of dodges were allowed, which
were ingenious if not particularly sporting. One
small boy tried to get to the top by covering his
hands and feet with sand, with which his pockets
were laden and bulging, while the man who eventually
got to the money hoisted himself by a device
of bars of wood and rope, which betrayed him at
once to C—— as a sailor. We very nearly gave up
waiting for this enterprising mariner, who took
an immense time to get up to the thin part at the
top of the pole, where he could abandon his contrivance
and get his hands round the bamboo—but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
he secured the prize, and the people below bellowed
with delight.</p>

<p>There were very few Americans amongst the
crowd, all the officers and officials being in the
stand, with many ladies in light frocks and big
hats, while the rank and file could be seen in the
bars round the Plaza, not caring a rap about tugs
of war or greasy poles, or their “little brown
brothers.” In the gaol the prisoners were crowded
at the barred windows, getting what fun they
could out of the general atmosphere of liberty; and
as we drove round the Plaza, I saw a most ragged
and miserable young countrywoman carrying a
sad, puny baby at her breast, talking to her man
through the bars of the prison, where the female
relations come and hand food in to the dark ragged
fellows inside. She slunk away round the Plaza,
and her face was too pitiful for words, she was so
gaunt and haggard. We had no money with us,
but I doubt if she would have taken it if we offered
it to her, as the country people are very proud, and
very sensitive about “<i lang="es">verguenza</i>,” which is Spanish
for shame. Very few of the white people seem to
understand this <i lang="es">verguenza</i>, by an appeal to which,
as I told you before, wonders can be done with a
Filipino.</p>

<p>This little incident put me out of humour with
the Declaration celebrations, so we drove out on
to the Molo road a little way and then returned,
and I had a good long rest before dinner to prepare
me for the evening’s festivities.</p>

<p>The day wound up with the ball at the Gobierno,
which is a kind of Government House comprising
public offices, and the Law Courts, and so forth. It
is a big building across the end of the Calle Real,
with a large over-hanging balcony or verandah,
under which the carriages pulled up on a stone-flag
pavement, all muddled up anyhow, anywhere, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
one turning and going out in any direction the
horse chose, with the usual shouting and confusion
and swearing on all sides.</p>

<p>The big stone basement was decorated with
palms tied against the columns, and Stars and
Stripes, and all up the staircase more Stars and
Stripes and more palms.</p>

<p>The ball went on chiefly in the Court Room, a
long narrow apartment, where the scheme of decoration
was half a dozen huge American flags draped
over the walls; and, stowed away over one doorway,
a few folds of the red and yellow of Spain.
On one side of the Court Room, through wide
arches, was another long room, and on the street
side was the long balcony, open to the night, and
cool when compared to the rooms.</p>

<p>When we arrived, the ball was in full blast with
the Official Rigodon, which C—— and Mr M——
who went with us, did not care to dance, and I
could not, so we sat in a row and looked on, and I
talked to an American friend we had met as we
came in. He asked me to dance, but I said that
was not possible for me, as my feet were still
unhealed, and all bandaged up for this dance.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said cheerfully, “I guess you are
right to be careful, because if you neglect those
things they turn into tropical ulcers, which are
<em>in</em>-curable.”</p>

<p>“Do they?” I said.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I had a friend who got mosquito
bites poisoned just so, and he died of them.”</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, I spent a very cheerful
evening, and was quite rewarded for the trouble of
going out by the spectacle itself. For some time
our American friend remained by us, as he said it
was the last chance he would have of seeing us to
say good-bye, because he was going back to the
United States. We asked him if he were going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
leave, but he said no, he was giving up his appointment;
which rather surprised us, as he is one of
the chief officials here, and has a very good position.
But he said he simply could not stand the Philippines
any longer, and would rather work for half the pay
in any other country.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he said, “I am entirely out of
sympathy with the whole thing, and can’t see what
we are doing here anyway.”</p>

<p>I said, “But you have the country to develop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sick of hearing that,” he said. “What
I want to do is to go right back to the States and
see some development done there.”</p>

<p>“Where do you mean?” we asked.</p>

<p>“Why, in my own State alone there are
hundreds of miles of virgin soil which I reckon I
want to see developed before these silly old islands.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” I said, “then you don’t like the
Philippines?”</p>

<p>“Have you ever met anyone who does?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “at any rate not one American
who does not loathe the place, except one woman,
the wife of a missionary, who says she likes it, but
then she spends all the disagreeable season in
Japan.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” he said. “And I guess if I come
back it’s going to be on the religious stunt, with no
work and lots of <em>va</em>-cation.”</p>

<p>The guests at the ball were all sorts and
conditions of men, rather what C—— calls a
“heterogeneous mass,” but most of the Americans
were there too, and several new people whom I
learned were officers and their wives from Camp
Josman, over in Guimaras. One little woman
particularly took my fancy, with her pale, pretty
face and masses of fair hair, and a really lovely
pink silk ball-dress. She looked so fresh and
charming, but I felt quite anxious about her nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
dress, as my own black skirt was a source of
trouble on such dirty boards, where, I am sorry to
say, some of the guests did not hesitate to
expectorate when they felt inclined for this national
pastime.</p>

<p>The floor, as I say, was simply rough, unpolished,
dusty, dark-wood planks, and all the American
men, except our friend and two others, wore day
suits and boots, while many of the women had on
walking shoes, which did not improve things.</p>

<p>The natives were all got up in blinding colours—little,
dark, square-faced women in the harsh aniline
dyes of thirty years ago—and some of them had
on very handsome diamonds. C—— and I and
Mr M—— were the only English people present.
I believe the others, as well as many of the
Americans, all thought the official ball not sufficiently
select, which seemed to me a very amusing
point of view in a place like Iloilo—or anywhere
else for the matter of that.</p>

<p>After watching the ball-room for a little while,
we thought we would like some fresh air, so we
moved out on to the balcony, where the air was
fairly cool, and where the band was stationed on a
platform of two steps in height. This was the
Constabulary, native brass, which sounds very well
out of doors in a procession, but is rather deafening
in a room. On the platform were two or three
music-stands at which a few men lounged, but the
rest of the twenty-five sat and blew (all brass and
two flutes) wherever they pleased, most of them
festooned gracefully about the steps of the stand;
some lying almost full length on one elbow; and
some huddled up with their chins on their knees,
looking exactly like performing monkeys. One
man with strips of black sticking-plaster on his flat,
brown face, lay on the steps of the stand, gazing at
the ceiling, and playing his cornet in one hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>There were benches all round the balcony, and
on one of these we sat, in company with a
lot of other guests, while some energetic and
perspiring dancers came out and extended the
ball to the balcony, dancing solemnly up and down
in front of the band. When some people moved
away from the bench nearest the platform, half
a dozen bandsmen instantly took possession of
their vacant places and sat there, leaning back
and blowing away at greater ease. They seemed
to be playing instinctively while thinking of other
things. One small boy on the bench by us was
fast asleep, with his fingers still moving up and
down on the stops, which so interested Mr M——
that he got up and put his ear down to the fellow’s
trumpet, but declared he could hear no sound
coming out of it at all. The other bandsmen
watched him do this with impassive, expressionless
faces, if they looked at him at all. This was
during the second Rigodon, which we could see
going on in the long Court Room, and when the
last figure was reached, a bandsman suddenly
sprang up from a recumbent position on the
steps and tootled the first few bars of “Hiawatha,”
which they all struck into with a swing, and
some of the sleepers opened one dull eye, while
the man with the black sticking-plaster on his
face was suddenly galvanised into walking up
and down to the tune—a sort of dancing walk—in
front of the bandstand.</p>

<p>While we sat by the band, we were joined by
another American friend, also a “prominent
citizen,” with whom I had a long and interesting
shout about the Philippines in general, and Mr
Taft in particular, which was most entertaining,
for this friend was as ardent a pro-Filipino as
the other had been anti-Taft and anti-everything.
This man was very enthusiastic about Mr Taft’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
scheme, as he called it, and when I said,
“What scheme?” he replied:</p>

<p>“Why, the way we run these Islands.”</p>

<p>Whereupon we entered upon a hot discussion,
for I was all in favour of roads and irrigation,
and he was all for school-desks and more teachers.
I quoted a paragraph I had seen in the Manila
papers, where the public were informed that
some new and wonderfully fertile valley had
been opened up in the Island of Luzon, and that
the Government’s first care had been to send ten
thousand school-desks to this favoured spot.
Whereupon he said:</p>

<p>“Well, what is the matter with that, anyway?”</p>

<p>I begged him to consider what Ceylon would
be now if Sir Samuel Baker had opened it up with
school-desks instead of roads and reservoirs.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, “I never thought of it in that
way. But perhaps our idea of raising these races
is right. It is an experiment which time will
prove.”</p>

<p>And that we argued too, with a running
comment of amusement on the <i lang="es">baile</i>, in spite of
the loud blasts of the band.</p>

<p>Before we left, we had excellent supper in a
side-room, where two long tables stood covered
with food, and all the ceiling was draped with
loops of greenery and paper lanterns. There were
plates set out, each with a helping of excellent
cold turkey in the middle surrounded by little
piles of stuffing and vegetables and things, which
we followed by very nice meringues, and accompanied
with delicious iced drinks—ice from the
Government factory—such a treat! While we
were at supper, standing at one of the long tables, a
paper lamp flared up and fell in a flaming mass just
behind me. C—— and some Spaniards promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
stamped it out. But some of the women were
frightened, so the Spaniards sang out:</p>

<p>“Terminado! Terminado!”</p>

<p>And everyone went on eating again.</p>

<p>A little group of natives and <i lang="es">Mestizos</i> came
into the room immediately afterwards, but they
had not seen the lamp fall, and one of the women
in a light trailing gown passed over some
smouldering fragments. C—— sprang forward
and said in Spanish:</p>

<p>“Your dress! There has been a lamp burnt
there!” And pointed to the sparks.</p>

<p>But the woman merely glared over her shoulder,
as if he had offered her some insult. I could
gladly have stuck my fork into her impudent,
bold, brown face, and can’t, as yet, see why in the
Eternal Fitness of Things she did not catch fire
and flare up.</p>

<p>After supper we watched a waltz and a two-step,
and then went away about twelve.</p>

<p>On our way out I passed one of the alcove
openings into the inner room, where I saw a sad,
white Bouguereau Madonna face looking up at
a man bending down, and recognised one of the
heroines of the late <i lang="es">funcion</i> (a delightful Spanish
slang word) next door. So I perceived that the
Marble Misery was a chronic pose, and nothing at
all to do with her relations stabbing each other.
Only, I must say she looked more “in the picture,”
running down the street with her hair streaming,
than in a bright ball-room.</p>

<p>We had gone to the <i lang="es">baile</i> in a hired <i lang="es">quilez</i>, as we
did not want to take our own frisky pony out on such
a night of Chinese crackers underfoot and rockets
overhead, and we had told the <i lang="es">quilez</i> man to come
back for us. To our astonishment, he did so.
Not that it was much of a treasure in the way of a
carriage, for it was so badly balanced that our weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
at the back would have lifted the pony clean off
the ground if the driver had not kept the balance
by squatting on the shafts over the pony’s tail.
The little animal tore along, and it was a wonder
and a mystery to see how the driver stuck on at all.
It was probably chiefly done with his toes, for
Filipino toes stand apart, supple like fingers, and
are used in the most marvellous and uncanny ways.
In the streets the Filipinos wear, or ought to wear,
only slippers of gaudy velvet, called <i lang="es">chinelas</i>, but
many of them now affect stockings and pointed
shoes, which I think must be one of the most
doubtful blessings of civilisation. In the procession
I noticed many of the little school girls and boys
with stockings on and awful shoes, and one or two
of the little girls even wore hats, but, if I described
them to you, you would not believe me!</p>

<p>Well, have you ever had such a long letter in
your life? And yet there is any amount more to
tell you if I only had the energy to write it.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_36">LETTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">COCK-FIGHTING—PULAJANES</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>July 14, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I know you will be sorry to hear that the last
of our dear little mongeese is dead—killed by the
dogs next door a week ago. We heard squeaking
and barking and scuffling in the alley-way one
evening, and rushed to the windows, but it was all
dark below, and we could see nothing. So C——
and Sotero went down with a lamp, but there was
nothing to be seen, and when we sent in to ask
the old Tagalo dressmaker about it, they all swore
they had heard nothing. So we hoped it was only
a rat; but we waited in vain for our poor little
pet to come back, and she never appeared again.</p>

<p>I could not bear the sight of the empty cage,
and made the boys take it away after a day or
two, and now I find it stands on the Azotea,
with Sotero’s rooster sitting solemnly on a perch
that has been fixed across the middle. This is
the same cock, by-the-bye, that travelled back with
us from Nagaba, and when C—— asks the boy
about it, he always says it is “going to fight for
fifteen <i lang="es">pesos</i>” on some Sunday—which never comes.
The cock is as tame with Sotero as a dog, and
allows itself to be combed and stroked the way
one sees all the Filipinos do to their fighting-cocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus22">
<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Village Cock-Fight.</span></p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_287"><i>To face page 287.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>In the native huts the fighting-cock is a very
precious and sacred person, enthroned on a special
perch at one end of the living-room. The night
before he fights, this warrior is watched with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
greatest care to see which point of the compass
he faces, as on that omen hang many events, for
if the creature faces the east he is bound to win,
but if he is turned towards the west you may
as well not take him to the battle at all. A little
hope is left, however, for when the cocks all crow
before the dawn, he who makes the first scrawk
is bound to win, and you can put your last <i lang="es">peseta</i>
on him.</p>

<p>The poor beasts are taken to the ring, where
spurs of curved steel are fastened to the back of
their heels, which makes the fight pretty short and
decisive, and may be indirectly merciful if it helps
towards a swift death. The making of the blades
is a fine art, and they are carefully carried about in
a small box with a little stone on which to sharpen
them. When one sees a Filipino on the way to a
cock-fight, with his bird sitting on his arm, there is
generally another native walking beside him,
carrying this little black box containing the spurs
and the little whet-stone.</p>

<p>There is as much roguery and “doping”
amongst these cock-fighters as there is about
horse-racing amongst “civilised” men, and some of
the dodges are really very ingenious, such, for
instance, as taking tiny pills of opium or other
poison under the finger nail and dropping them in
front of your opponent’s bird when it is pecking
about before the contest begins.</p>

<p>Before the fight the interested parties are
allowed to test the roosters, like looking at a horse
in the paddock, only they enjoy advantages which
I believe are not to be indulged in a paddock at
a race-meeting, for they may form their opinion of
a bird by picking the animal up and feeling its
muscles, looking at its thighs and examining its
feet, of all of which points the Filipino is a
wonderful judge, being able to graduate his large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
bets on the feeling of a muscle with great certainty.
All the same, this is the occasion, if he is so minded
and the other man is not quick enough, to injure
the animal by means of a sharp pin point hidden
in the palm of the hand or between the fingers.</p>

<p>I notice that the fighting-cocks here don’t have
their breasts pulled bare of feathers like those poor
birds we saw in that old man’s house below the
walls of the Alhambra. Do you remember how
bald and horrible they looked? And how the old
villain who kept them told us he pulled the feathers
out and rubbed in spirits to keep the skin hard?
They don’t seem to do that here, for I have never
seen a bare-breasted cock, and never met anyone
who has heard of such a custom.</p>

<p>The General has gone off to Samar, the long
island parallel to this, and on the other side of
Cebú—though I can only use those terms vaguely,
and by way of a general indication to you where
to look on a map. The island is now under martial
law, owing to the patriotism and enterprise of
certain jolly fellows, called Pulajanes, going about
with big curved <i lang="es">bolos</i>, and old Spanish flint-locks,
and in fact anything they can catch hold of. These
persons are really patriots of a most irreconcilable
type, but it suits the programme of the Government
to label them <i lang="es">ladrones</i> (robbers), and to refer to
their own hard fights with them as “cleaning up the
province.” On the strength of this nickname, the
Americans cut down these patriots freely (when the
Pulajanes do not do the cutting down first), and if
they catch them alive the poor devils are hanged
like common criminals.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The papers continue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
publish long eulogiums on the peace and prosperity
of the Philippines, and all the time the richest
commercial centre of the Archipelago is under
martial law, with all its business houses shut
down; and soldiers and officers continue to arrive
at the hospital here every now and then, with more
or less severe wounds. Also waggons occasionally
go past from the barracks, piled up with baggage,
and followed by troops in service kit, and one hears
that they have “gone to the front.”</p>

<p>For some time past the staff of C——’s firm has
been increased here, in this Iloilo branch, by the
absorption into it of one of their men from
Catbologan, the chief town of Samar, as their
business there, along with all the others in that
island, has had to be shut down.</p>

<p>There is desultory fighting even here, in Panay,
but we never hear of it except as an occasional
paragraph in a Manila paper.</p>

<p>So much for peace. As to prosperity, there is
general scarcity, many districts suffer actual
famine. In Cebú the lower classes are chiefly
dependent on an allowance of so many sacks of
rice a day, the gift of the Chinamen! In that
town, indeed, matters are so bad that siege-like
conditions prevail, and amongst other horrible
things that happened, a starving native woman
lately killed and ate her own baby. This is not
hearsay, but sober reports in the <cite>Manila Times</cite>.</p>

<p>I am paying the penalty of my recklessness in
having gone to the Declaration Day ball, for the little
walking I did that night made my feet very painful
again, and I am laid up in bed once more, reading
papers and trying to forget my American friend’s
optimistic remarks about tropical ulcers. The
doctor tells me I want feeding up to get the poison
out of my system, and this I can quite believe, but
fail to see how it is to be brought about. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
tried drinking a little wine, but that makes my
prickly heat unendurable. The Spaniards here
drink <i lang="es">tinto</i>—the red Spanish wine one gets at
<i lang="fr">tables d’hôte</i> in Spain—but it has to be spirited up
for export, so out here it is rather heady and sour;
but I am sure it must be more wholesome than the
whisky and soda of the English people, or the
eternal tea of the American women. You will be
tired of hearing about my mosquito bites, but I
must just tell you one new thing that I have heard
about this unpleasant ailment, which is that many
people think the poison is introduced by flies—one
fly would be quite enough! There were no flies, or
very few, when we came here at first, in the dry
season, but with the rain they have appeared in
black swarms, and we live surrounded by large
sheets of sticky paper with Tangle Foot written on
them—a delightful American expression! Here
again I am reminded of the amount of indifference
shown to an animal in proportion to its size—comparative
with that of a human being. For can
you imagine anyone being tolerated, who caught
cats or horses in deep, thick glue and let them
slowly struggle to death? Yet what are you to do
with flies? You can’t catch each one—first catch
your fly, in fact—and then kill it in the quickest
and most scientific manner. No. It must be
Tangle Foot papers. But even though I find I am
simply compelled to have them about the house,
when I see a fly trying to haul one foot after the
other out of the dreadful Tangle Foot, I can’t help
appreciating the poor insect’s point of view.</p>

<p>The old millionaire I told you about is still
here, and everyone is trying to be civil to him,
but I hear he is very difficult to entertain, for he
insists on being the only man to talk, which he
does very slowly and in an almost unintelligible
accent. He gives considerable annoyance, too, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
his bad clothes, dirty hands, and unshaven face,
and one can’t help sympathising with the men who
are irritated by such slovenliness, or agreeing with
them, that it is not much good being a millionaire if
you can’t get hold of a decent tailor and a razor
and some soap!</p>

<p>I think I told you that our friend Mr —— sent
his wife and family off to Hong Kong when the
heat began? They have come back, and are giving
me so much annoyance by rhapsodies over the
climate, the cheapness of everything, and the good
food in Hong Kong that at last I had to <em>beg</em> them
to say no more! Mrs —— is still comparing prices
here with prices there, and she brought back pretty
things for her house, which make me wild with
envy—or would if we were not soon to pass to
happier climes! Her husband went to fetch his
little tribe, and he is raving, not so much about the
comparison of prices and the joys of fresh milk,
fruit, and vegetables as the horrible imposition of
being compelled to pay the Philippine Cedula Tax
all over again. Five <i lang="es">pesos</i> a head—10 shillings
each for his wife, the three children, and the nurse!
And what annoyed him most of all, I think, was
his having been away about three weeks himself
and having to pay it again too. However, it has
been worth the money to them, I should think, for
they all look quite brown and jolly compared to the
people here, and quite different beings to the
washed-out folk they were when they went away.
At this time of year, as I think I told you, all the
Hong Kong people who can afford it go home or
to Shanghai or Japan, as they consider Hong Kong
at this season not fit to live in!</p>

<span class="smaller">A PEARL OF GREAT PRICE</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>July 14, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We are having much cooler weather now, the
thermometer sometimes as low as 77°, and hardly
ever above 80°, and at night it has even been down
to 64°. We have had some spells of hot sunshine,
which have brought the flowers out in the few
gardens and the cemeteries. We get a trayful now
and then of all sorts of queer-looking blossoms,
mostly bright reds and yellows, with no smell, and
very gaudy and handsome. Many of them I have
seen in hothouses at home, especially one big
bright yellow funnel-shaped flower; but I don’t
know any of their names, except the native words
told me by the charming white-haired old Filipino
gardener who brings them. Amongst the last lot
was a thing exactly like a large periwinkle, which
made me think at once of the garden at home, and
some stuff like May-blossom, which made me feel
more homesick than ever! They are beautiful, all
these flowers, when they come in fresh, but there is no
scent about them, and they seldom live twenty-four
hours. One I do recognise, and that is the Canna
lily, which I have seen in hothouses at home, and
some irises of different sorts. I am feeling much
better, so we went for a drive yesterday between
the showers, but got caught in two tremendous
squalls—one in the town and one on the Molo
road. The <i lang="es">calesa</i> has a hood, which is raised on
crooks, and one can shut oneself in altogether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
heavy rain, with an arrangement of waterproof
curtains, the reins passing through a hole in the
high apron. It looks so funny, in wet weather,
to see the bottled-up <i lang="es">calesas</i> going about, being
driven as by magic, with the miserable <i lang="es">sota</i> (groom)
trying to make the best of his narrow perch
behind.</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_293"><i>To face page 293.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The roads were a maze of huge pools of water,
through which we just splashed anyhow, and all the
palm-groves were brilliantly green, and full of new
little fairy lakes, which looked so lovely that they
were well worth the discomforts of the drive.
Near the huge Priests’ College, a little way out of
Iloilo, we saw some <i lang="es">carabaos</i> having a glorious
time in various new pools. They looked very
picturesque, with their great dark curved horns,
standing out against the shining water and the
green grass. The greenness is wonderful—too
wonderful. There is no beauty of purples and
soft blues about a wet day here; it is all grey and
green, and even the little lakes in the palm-groves
are very garish, and all exactly alike. One longs
for a change of colouring, and these crude tints get
on one’s nerves like an oleograph in a hotel.</p>

<p>Talking of nerves, the perpetual sounds were
added to, as soon as the rainy season set in, by the
bell-like voices of countless frogs, singing in every
ditch and pool. They sing in the day, but at night
they are loudest, or else most noticeable, and their
melodious notes might be pretty if one heard less
of them and a long way off.</p>

<p>A day or two ago Sotero came to me saying
that a woman was at the door wanting to sell me
a ring. I said I would look at it; so he went off
and brought me a dirty little piece of newspaper,
out of which emerged a huge pearl set in a very
common, florid, claw setting. I looked at the
pearl and saw that though it was white enough, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
was very rough, with no iridescent lustre, what
connoisseurs call “skin,” I believe. I also noticed
that as the stone tapered away, and was discoloured
under the setting, it could not be worth more
than £10 at the most. But Sotero said the
woman wanted two hundred <i lang="es">pesos</i> (£20), so the
incident came to a rapid close. When C——
came back in the middle of the day, and I told him
about the ring, he said he knew it quite well, for it
had been hawked all over Iloilo; and everyone
thought the price asked a preposterous sum. In spite
of which the woman refused all reasonable offers.</p>

<p>The pearl came from the pearl-fisheries of the
Philippines, which are chiefly in the Sulu Islands,
far away South, where the Philippines almost
touch British North Borneo. They say the pearls
are not very good ones at the best, but none of the
best specimens find their way about the Islands, for
they are sent straight away to Singapore by the
Chinamen who own the fisheries. Here there are
oysters with beautiful, transparent, white pearl
shells, of which the small panes of the rain-shutters
are made; but these shells have no pearls in them,
and are of very little value. Besides these oysters,
we get all manner of shell-fish—crabs, cray-fish,
clams, shrimps, as well as soles, sprats, whiting,
and quantities of other fish. Indeed the supply
of fish is wonderfully varied and always exquisitely
fresh, except on Fridays, when the servants of all
good Catholics clear the markets, or even secure
the fish before they get into the markets at all. In
stormy weather, too, we don’t get much fish, but, as
a rule, the supply is a great boon, and one of our
chief sources of sustenance. I was astonished to
find in Manila that fish was very scarce and dear,
and people there envied us the fish here, while those
who only knew Manila refused even to believe that
we could have such a supply at all!</p>

<span class="smaller">AGRICULTURAL POSSIBILITIES</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>July 31</i>.</p>

<p>I think I told you we had been very lucky in the
selling of the greater part of our furniture, and now
we have got the <i lang="es">calesa</i> and pony off our hands as
well, which is a great loss in the evenings, but we
had to take what chance we could. Some of the
young Englishmen got up a Gymkhana on the
beach yesterday, and C—— rode the pony for the
last time, when he was lucky enough to win two
races out of three, and only missed the third by a
misunderstanding about the start.</p>

<p>It was a dull, showery afternoon, unfortunately,
but when the rain went off, I strolled down to
the beach to see if anything was to be seen. I
found crowds of Filipinos standing about the upper
part of the beach, and a few hurdles down on the
sands, which the receding tide had left quite firm.
The competitors, who included some of the young
Spaniards and <i lang="es">Mestizos</i>, were riding up and down,
and just as I arrived on the scene, a race came flying
along in great style, to the intense joy of the native
onlookers.</p>

<p>The occasion was enlivened by the <i lang="es">banda de
musica popular</i>, the members of which had been
on their way to play in the Plaza, but had strolled
down to the beach, where they stood amongst the
crowd, and every now and then blew and tootled
a tune while they goggled about.</p>

<p>I signalled to our <i lang="es">sota</i> and made him go up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the house and fetch me a chair, on which I sat and
watched the race. As I sat there a Filipino youth
came up and very civilly asked me if the <i lang="es">señora</i>
wanted a <i lang="es">muchacho</i>, but I said I did not, as I was
quite content with the servants I had at present.</p>

<p>We have had one or two very fine days again
lately, and have been for one or two drives, but
some very blood-thirsty road-mending has been
going on, to prepare the town for the critical eyes
of the Taft party, who are to arrive here from
Manila on the 14th or 15th of next month. This
road-mending is done by hauling the volcanic
gravel out of the river beds, and dumping it in
huge piles along the middle of the roads, and as
the thoroughfares are not lighted, the result is a
wild steeplechase with one wheel in the air. Sometimes
fellows come along and spread the gravel out,
but more generally it just spreads itself. It makes
very soft roads, which the heavy <i lang="es">carabao</i>-carts
plough up at once.</p>

<p>One of the last drives we took was to visit the
foreign cemetery, which is on the outskirts of the
town, on a road running parallel to the beach. We
got out of the trap at a tall wooden gate, which an
old man opened to us, and walked up a short avenue
of flowering bushes and palms. The graves stood
on a grassy plot, with bushes growing about it,
laden with large red or yellow blossoms, and crossed
at right angles by sandy paths bordered with tiles.
They were not ordinary graves, like those one sees
at home, for each one was a sort of small brick
tunnel some feet from the ground, and closed by
a cemented tablet. There were names of some
English people on one or two of them, and one had
just been opened to send the bones of the occupant
back to his native land. The man had been dead
twenty-five years, and it seemed to me hardly worth
while to disturb him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>A little behind the main row of tombs we came
on a Jewish grave—a big marble sarcophagus—with
an iron rail round it and inscriptions in Hebrew
on the flat top. The marble was native to this
country, I have no doubt, as there is plenty of it
in the Philippines; in fact some of the small islands
are known to be of solid marble, but it does not
pay to work them—did I not tell you this before,
though?</p>

<p>Mr B—— came to call this afternoon, and was
very indignant about local justice, as it appears
that one of his Filipino clerks was impudent to
a white man in his firm, whereupon the white man
naturally struck the Filipino as any ordinary man
of grit strikes a man who is rude to him. However,
the cur Filipino went off to the police and
lodged a complaint. The white man was had up,
and has been heavily fined for “assaulting” the
Filipino, and Mr B—— says:</p>

<p>“What on earth are you to do with impertinent
natives if you don’t hit them? They don’t
care a straw if you dismiss them, and take not
the least notice of reproof.”</p>

<p>But I think there is right on both sides, for the
way some of the white men hit their servants
about is brutal and foolish. I said something
to this effect, whereupon Mr B—— said, very much
surprised:</p>

<p>“Why, doesn’t your husband have to kick
your fellows about?”</p>

<p>And he was quite incredulous when I assured
him that C—— had never dreamed of such a thing
except once, when our first cook had muttered
impertinences, and been kicked out on to the
Azotea for his rudeness.</p>

<p>“But they are such stupid fools,” argued Mr
B——.</p>

<p>We replied that we did not think blows would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
make them any brighter, on which he laughed
and said perhaps we were right, as we certainly
had remarkably good servants.</p>

<p>Another guest, Mr M——, was talking about
Philippine food, and observed that tomatoes
grew so well here. I said I thought they were
miserable failures, as they are about the size of
walnuts, and quite green. But he maintained that
that was because the Filipino just sticks his tomato
plants in the ground and goes off to sit in the shade
or to a cock-fight, and when he sees any sign of
fruit on the plants, he picks it and takes it to
market. Any notion of tilling the soil—weeding
or manuring—is absolutely unknown to these
people, or if known, carefully avoided. Mr M——
said he had seen tomatoes, grown by Chinamen,
as good as the very best out of a hothouse at
home. There are several Chinese <i lang="fr">potagères</i> in
the town where rows of trim little beds may be seen
thick with extraordinarily luxuriant crops of vegetables
of every sort, but out here no one will
eat anything grown by the Chinamen, as those
enterprising people employ some dreadful and
unmentionable methods of agriculture. Besides
this, there are many germs in the teeming, prolific
air which invest vegetables such as cabbages,
lettuce, etc., and make them very unsafe experiments,
even if one can procure any. When
I was in Manila, there was a good deal of talk
at dinner tables, and much writing in the papers
about some American scientist who professed to
have found out a way to “treat” the Philippine
green lettuces before eating them, so as to destroy
some dreadful germ which causes horrible complaints.
But it seemed to me less trouble and a
great deal safer to give up lettuce as a bad job!</p>

<p>The great and terrible fear in the Philippines is
the germ of a disease called “sprue”—a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
wasting away—which is very difficult to remedy,
and almost ineradicable.</p>

<p>Melons would grow well here, for in the wet
season anything in the nature of a gourd springs
up like a weed—a habit which suits the Filipino
agriculturist to perfection. Some of the more
energetic spirits fasten a piece of <i lang="es">bejuco</i> from
the marrow plant up to a window, and gourd
vines may often be seen obligingly toiling up a
string to hand fruit in to the weary dwellers in
a <i lang="es">nipa</i> hut. Nevertheless, melons are only to be
got from Hong Kong, and even then they are a
costly delicacy. Some friends sent us half a watermelon
a few days ago, as a present, but we did not
like to accept anything so valuable, and insisted on
paying for it. What a treat it was!</p>

<p>With the rainy season we also have a tiny
hard native fruit that looks like a damson outside,
but has white flesh with a stone like a date-stone,
and is entirely devoid of any flavour of any sort.
I tried having this fruit stewed, but it was even
nastier than when raw. When we were at
Nagaba for the day, in the spring, we got some
fruit like knobs of rose-coloured wax, pink all
through, with black pips, and rather tart, but also
tasteless. I suppose all these insipid, nasty little
native fruits could be cultivated into something
nice, in the way that cherries have been developed,
and apples and everything else, from the tasteless
wild fruit. At present, however, they are tolerable
only to the native palate. The best of them
is a tiny brown fruit called <i lang="es">lazones</i>, which has a
fluffy thin brown skin, and grey brown flesh in
divisions like an orange, each division containing
a large green seed. The flavour of the <i lang="es">lazones</i>
is sharp, rather nice, and very refreshing, but this
fruit only comes from Luzon, and is very expensive,
besides being half-rotten by the time it gets here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Bananas, pine-apples, and mangoes—that is all.
Bananas one gets unutterably sick of, and pine-apples
too—and mangoes, even if one likes them
(which we do not), give one prickly heat. In
fact tinned strawberries and raspberries are about
the best Philippine fruits.</p>

<p>We have received an invitation to the banquet
in honour of Mr Taft and his party on the 15th—on
the payment of 12 <i lang="es">pesos</i> each. But we may
have to sail before that date if our Hong Kong
steamer comes in. I shall be very sorry if we
miss that event, for I think the Taft utterances
would be well worth 25 shillings a head, though
that does seem a pretty stiff sum for an Iloilo
banquet!</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_39">LETTER XXXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">A LAST DAY AT NAGABA—THE “SECWAR”</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>August 11, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We went a last trip to Nagaba on Sunday, but
only for the day, and were lucky in having very
fine weather and delightfully cool, only 80°, with a
lovely breeze blowing, and the sky a little overcast.</p>

<p>We roused ourselves up after lunch, and two
friends came to the house to join the party, and we
sent the “boy” for two <i lang="es">quilezes</i>. When we went
down, I stepped into the first one; there was Tuyay
lying in it already! How she knows when we are
going out is simply marvellous.</p>

<p>We drove to the Muelle Loney, at the farther
end of which <i lang="es">paraos</i> are moored for hire, and
chose a nice big boat, the <i>Valentino</i>, with an upper
deck of split bamboo, a rabbit-hutch cabin of <i lang="es">nipa</i>
matting, and a crew of eight men, and set sail for
Nagaba.</p>

<p>The sun came out soon after we started, so we
lay half in and half out of the cabin and the shade
it cast. It was a “three-man breeze,” so some
of the crew ran out on the outriggers and others
hauled ropes, while three ruffians sat on the deck,
which was 3 feet wide, by-the-bye, and spread out
a piece of blue paper, which they held down with
their bare brown toes. We could not think what
they were going to do, when, to our astonishment,
one of them produced a pack of greasy cards and
pieces of money and began the three-card trick!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
They did their best to get us interested in the
game, the chief little old brown swindler losing to
his confederates all in the best Derby style. We
looked on with deep interest, but showed no signs
of wishing to take part in the gamble, except for
C—— to ask casually if they knew he was in the
Secret Police, which made them look quite serious
for a few minutes. This remark about Secret
Police was no empty jest, for it is an Institution of
the Free and Enlightened U.S.A., worthy of Russia
or the Dark Ages. Well, after this disquieting
joke about the Secret Police, the three-card trick
seemed to lose its flavour, and the gamblers shifted
billet again, to our intense amusement, crawling
along the outriggers, and past the “cabin,” and on
to the tiny space of after-deck, where the steersman
sat huddled up with his legs round the tiller. Here
they spread the blue paper out again, one of the
confederates lying airily across the stern entrance,
betting excitedly, with an occasional squint into
the cabin to see if anyone was inclined to slip aft on
the sly. But we never even looked round, so they
soon abandoned that tactic and climbed on to the
“cabin” roof, where they crouched like monkeys,
chattering, and now and then a great flat brown
face hung over the edge and looked down in on us;
but we got rather tired of them, so C—— leaned
out and hit one of them, and they gave that up too.</p>

<p>All this time we were skimming through the
water, going at a tremendous pace, the boat leaning
over first to one side and then to the other, with
the white foam spurting up from the brilliant green
sea, the half-naked brown sailors running out on
the long poles of the outriggers, and the big sails
filled out tight. It was most exhilarating.</p>

<p>We went straight across, a little wide of
Nagaba, and then made a wide tack, which enabled
the boat to go quite close to the beach, as the tide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
was high, and we came up right opposite the
village. One of the boatmen carried me ashore,
and the moment Tuyay saw me leave the ship, she
flung herself into the water and swam after me in
a sort of tragic despair that made us all laugh very
much.</p>

<p>Then other brawny little natives took C——
and our two friends astride on their shoulders and
set us all down on the dry sand, and we walked
up through the little village of huts, all amongst the
babies and dogs and pigs. There were several
new swamps to be seen, and everything was even
greener than when we were last there, which was
before the S.-W. Monsoon had really set in. I
noticed, too, that the bushes had flowered, as our
friends had predicted, and one of them was a
beautiful, scentless yellow blossom, a little like a
snapdragon.</p>

<p>We had meant to go for a real walk, but the
sun was too hot, as it was not more than four
o’clock, so we wandered along to “our” house,
through the fields and village. It was delightful
to feel the fresh country air, and to smell the earth
and plants after the streets of Iloilo, and we actually
felt hungry, and began to ask each other what was to
be done about food. Nothing was to be had at any
house in the village, as we all knew by experience,
but by luck we came upon a sort of open <i lang="es">nipa</i>
shed, where a little Filipino woman was standing
behind a wooden tray containing ears of maize,
little heaps of rice, and betel-nut, which was by
way of being a shop. From her, and a youth
who cropped up from nowhere and conducted the
bargaining, we bought what the Americans call corn-pone,
which is whole ears of young maize roasted.
We munched the corn, which was very sweet and
tender, and uncommonly filling—after about half a
“pone” one could hardly breathe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>A little further on we regretted our haste in
satiating ourselves with maize, as we saw a big
open shed, with two steps up to it, and all sorts
of glasses and dishes glittering on a table spread
with a white cloth, evidently a sort of <i lang="es">Fiesta</i>
restaurant. We cheered up at this, and hurried
along with talk of fizzing drinks, but when we came
nearer, and out of the full glare of the sunlight,
we got a horrible shock on finding it to be the
Aglipay church!</p>

<p>So we trailed on, rather despondent, and very
thirsty, between the huts and boats, through the
deep soft sand, which was unpleasant to walk on.
We saw a big <i lang="es">parao</i> lying drawn up, hewn out of
one vast tree-trunk, which is the original model
of these long, narrow boats, and it looked like a
huge <i lang="es">baroto</i> (canoe).</p>

<p>When we got to the house, Tuyay was greeted
most enthusiastically by a little spaniel friend, and
the caretakers were civil enough to us, but incredibly
stupid about a request for coffee. At last C——
made them understand by talking to them in
Visayan, but it is really very strange how very few
of the people in the country know any Spanish,
and the town’s-people can only say a few words or
phrases at the best.</p>

<p>We took chairs out of the house, opened the
sliding bamboo frames shutting off the balcony, and
established ourselves out there in the cool shade.
There we sat for an hour, munching maize, and
watching three fowls and three brown babies picking
up mysterious food on the rocks and in the
shallow pools. One of the babies was an elderly
person of five or six, who was “minding” the other
two, and one could see that he was older and more
important, as he had on a very short and entirely
foolish white muslin shirt, but the other two were
in nothing but fat brown skin. The tiniest was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
very serious and bullet-headed little chap, with thin
arms and legs, and a huge rice-tummy. All three
mites were squatting about, very busy and solemn,
finding some little shell-fish, which they cracked
between stones and ate with the gestures of
monkeys.</p>

<p>They were to us a source of absolute delight,
and it was not till the elderly pastor in the muslin
shirt led his flock off to fresh pools out of sight that
we went into the house and drank the coffee which
the woman had prepared for us. It was excellent
black coffee, made in the native fashion by holding
the grounds in a little bag at the end of a piece of
bamboo in a coffee pot—simple, but effective.
With it went large flat cakes of yellowish sugar,
called <i lang="es">caramelo</i>, and she had also produced from
somewhere four ship’s biscuits. The latter were
rather a relief after the maize, and indeed we
thought the meal a delicious feast, though I have
no doubt we would not have looked at it over the
other side of the Guimaras Channel.</p>

<p>After this, as it was about six o’clock, and the
sun was going down, we walked down to the
river mouth and got on board the good ship
<i>Valentino</i> by crawling along another <i lang="es">parao</i>, which
was beached in the shallower water further inshore,
and thence by perilous ventures along those outriggers
on which the sailors run about in a gale as
if they were on firm land!</p>

<p>The sail back in the sunset was exquisite, all
the mountains of Panay dark blue against an
orange sky, a young moon overhead, and the air
exquisitely fresh.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a most delightful trip, and I
only wish we had had more such days, but with
only one day a week to choose from it is often too
hot, and sometimes too wet to go on the water.
Most of the time, too, I have not been well enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
for expeditions under the most favourable circumstances,
and then, over and above all these reasons
is the fact that one seldom has the inclination here
to do anything or go anywhere. I think it must be
owing to this latter phenomenon that there is no
sort of “week-end resort” at Nagaba, for one can
hardly understand how such an enterprising people
as the Americans have neglected this golden
opportunity for a business that, I believe, they
understand so admirably—I mean sort of Simple
Life Hotels. I remember an American whom I met
at home once, in England, telling me a long story
about some place in the Adirondaks, where people
from New York (or was it Chicago?—no matter) go
and live in tents; and millionaires catch food, and
their priceless wives and daughters cook and sweep.
The story came up <i lang="fr">à propos</i> the daughter of a
millionaire who had just married an English duke,
as this personage had been roughing it in the next
tent to my friend. I think I may have told you
the story at the time. But I have read so much
and heard so much about the American love of
country life that I am astounded to see how they
all sit grilling in Iloilo when they might have a
hotel at Nagaba. The truth is, of course, that such
an enterprise might be a doubtful undertaking, as
every American I have ever yet met or seen, from
the highest to the humblest, is simply saving money
to get away from the Philippines and back to
“God’s Country.”</p>

<p>We are still undecided about our departure, as
the <i>Sung-Kiang</i> (the sister-ship of the <i>Kai-Fong</i>
and the same Line) has come in before what the
Americans call her “scheduled” time. That is a
very queer word of theirs, by-the-bye, and they work
the poor thing to death, making it do all sorts of
unnatural gymnastics in place of good, ready, useful
English. Probably we shall wait for the <i>Kai-Fong</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
but whichever we decide for, we shall not miss the
Taft party after all, which I am very pleased about,
and we have put our names down for the banquet.</p>

<p>They are in Manila now, the first intimation of
their arrival having been a telegram in the Iloilo
<cite>El Tiempo</cite>, headed “Impresiones de Miss Alice
Roosevelt”—who had not been an hour in the
Philippines, if she had landed at all, when the
impression was what newspaper language calls
“voiced.”</p>

<p>Now we have <cite>The Manila Times</cite> of that and
the following two days, which are “all Taft,” of
course, set forth in the quaintest concoction of
cheap picture-writing, bad grammar, and awkward,
slapdash slang. Much about “Miss Alice,”—a
whole column of an interesting description of that
lady’s every gesture at a race-meeting—in fact she
looms so large in the Philippine eye that it looks as
if she were here for a very good reason; perhaps to
take the fierce, white light off Mr Taft a little.
They allude to the latter, by-the-bye, as “the
<i>Secwar</i>,” which, when I first came across it, I took
to be the name of some Indian chief, but it at last
dawned upon me that the word was a contraction
of Secretary of War, and I have since been told
that it is his telegraphic address used as an
affectionate nickname.</p>

<p>The American reporter seems to be as virulent
in Manila as anywhere else, for before the party
had landed one of these human mosquitoes asked a
Senator what he thought of “these islands,” but the
visitor cleverly replied that he had come to gather
impressions, not to furnish them.</p>

<p>The papers are still full of guesses about the
true reasons for this visitation, for so many of them
persist in the theory that Mr Taft is not entirely
actuated by altruistic wishes for the welfare of his
“little brown brothers,” but has a wary eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
upon the elector at home, and will pose as the
Saint of the Philippines just as far as his own
interests are safe. I think it is a great shame to say
this, however, for it is obvious that he has done
the best he can for the Philippines according to his
views; and whether one agrees with his theories or
not, his good intentions are not to be denied. I
had a long talk with a man who has been here in a
good business for thirty-three years, and is supposed
to know more about the Philippines than any
other white man alive; and he told me that, as far
as enlightening the Senators went, he thought the
Taft visit was a costly farce, for they are to be
allowed to see and hear nothing that does not “suit
the Taft book.” A week in Manila of meetings,
balls, parties, and banquets, followed by flying visits
to the principal towns in the provinces and more
banquets, all feasting and flags and anthems; but
not a glimpse of the miserable, wasted agricultural
districts, the abandoned rice-fields, and the real
truth of the labour problem. Moreover, their
opinion of the self-government problem is to be
formed by the conversation of a few well-educated
and carefully selected <i lang="es">Mestizos</i> in the towns.</p>

<p>The natives, themselves, however, are tremendously
jubilant about the approaching visit of their
Patron Saint, and expect all blessings to spring up
miraculously in his footsteps.</p>

<p>Talking of natives, I am glad to say that our
three excellent servants have found good billets,
with a rise in importance and wages, and they are
all so pleased, poor souls, that we took the trouble
to recommend them to our friends. They did not
want much touting, for the spotless tidiness of their
appearance is an advertisement that speaks for
itself and their honesty is patent, for we trust them
in a way that no one else dreams of doing with their
Filipino servants. I don’t know how the two house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
boys will get on with impatient Englishmen, for
they are both very shy, faithful, simple countrymen—real
unspoilt Filipinos. But if they were spoken
to sharply, or muddled in their work, they would
become confused and stupid at once. Not that
there is anything peculiar to the Filipino race in
these traits, because they are perfectly familiar to
me in many kindly, simple, limited souls in other
latitudes. You have to take them as you find
them, only hoping, as with the same type at home,
that their secret cunning may be ranged on your
own side, and that if you can’t make a silk purse
out of a sow’s ear, you may perhaps manage to
contrive a useful little leather bag if you are
patient enough.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Note.</i>—I have before me <cite>The Manila Times</cite> of
17th January 1906, from which I give the following
extract:—“While the municipal and ecclesiastical
dignitaries, etc., were awaiting the arrival of
Secretary Taft, a Government vessel slowly made
her way up the Pasig river filled with the dead
and wounded from the island of Samar. During
the stay of the party in Manila, four native men
were brought in from the adjoining province of
Cavite frightfully mutilated because of their pro-American
sympathies.”</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_40">LETTER XL.<br />
<span class="smaller">PREPARATIONS</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>August 14, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We have now decided to go to Hong Kong by the
<i>Kai-Fong</i>, which sails next Saturday or Monday,
the 20th or 22nd. The <i>Sung-Kiang</i> loaded up as
much as she could and shoved off on Saturday, as
she did not want to be paying port dues here the
whole of to-day (Sunday) and to-morrow, which is
a public holiday, being the anniversary of the taking
of Manila by Admiral Dewey.</p>

<p>The transport conveying the Taft party is
<em>scheduled</em> to arrive here to-day, and this evening
they are to be present at a performance of the
Filipino Amateur Dramatic Club, to which we have
been invited by means of a huge printed invitation,
couched in elaborate Spanish, and adorned by many
ornaments and flourishes.</p>

<p>We heard the sound of a band going past very
early this morning, and when we went out on to
the balcony, we saw it was the Infantry band from
Guimaras, with the regiment behind them marching
down the street. They marched splendidly, and
the band was playing a most sad and beautiful
tune, which made one think of war, and troops
marching away, and women crying in the morning.
The soldiers had just arrived, I expect, for everyone
from Camp Josman is pouring into Iloilo for
the <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> for the Taft party.</p>

<p>Arches are being put up in the streets, and, as
everybody has been requested to decorate their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
houses, we have hoisted a Union Jack on a long
pole, and all this morning the servants were very
happy, in the pouring rain, sticking up palm-branches
which they had stolen from some plantation.
They are much excited about the arrival of
this hero of theirs, and one of them—who gets
confused when we accuse him of being an <i lang="es">Independiente</i>,
because he has his watch hung on a nail
in the kitchen, with a portrait of Rizal over it, a
sort of little shrine—is simply beaming with delight,
and can’t haul up enough palms.</p>

<p>In the office opposite, the native clerks are
surpassing themselves with archway and window
decorations of greenery and flowers; while the old
Tagalo dressmaker next door has been busy for a
week past making paper flowers of all the hues
under the sun. In that house, by-the-bye, the
stock of domestic pets has lately been increased by
the addition of a sheep, which is quite tame, for we
can hear its little hoofs tap-tapping over the bare
boards, and see it sitting amongst the work-girls in
the big front room. They have a nice little black
pig, too, also running about the house and equally
tame, and in the evenings the old man goes out for
a walk to the beach with the fat old brown dog,
the pig, and the sheep all running after him and
playing about. I have often seen them go along
the street—such a curious company! And people
who live near the beach tell me he takes them all
down to the sea, washes them, and then walks
about to give them an airing. They are all sharing
in the popular rejoicings, too, for the brown dog and
the pig have got on necklaces of paper flowers,
while the sheep is crowned in the most arcadian
fashion.</p>

<p>Mr Taft has made a lot of speeches in Manila,
but, so far, they have only contained very nebulous
references to the Independence question; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
he has cast a sop to the malcontents by promises
of abolition or reduction of certain export duties,
by which the excited Filipinos argue and predict
a millennium of agricultural improvement and
general plenty.</p>

<p>But none of the business men are very clear as
to how this miracle is to be wrought, for the
Government will not lower the standard of wages;
Chinese labour will not be allowed in; and the
Filipino will not suddenly, if ever, become a thrifty,
hard-working tiller of the soil, even if he passes all
the standards of the American schools.</p>

<p>One paragraph stowed away in a corner of <cite>The
Manila Times</cite> made us laugh very much, for it was
an account of how Poblete de los Reyes (a Filipino
<i lang="es">Independiente</i> agitator) and Father Aglipay were
“haunting the corridors of the Ayuntamento” (the
<i lang="es">Gobierno</i> of Manila), “but up to noon to-day they
had failed to get the ear of Secretary Taft.”</p>

<p>This gave me a delightful vision of those two
anxious flat brown faces peering out of all sorts of
shadowy places, and Mr Taft for ever making a break
for another room, and rushing through suites and up
and down little staircases to escape the gen-u-<em>ine</em>
patriots. This is only a fancy picture, of course, but
still it may contain a grain of truth, and at any rate
it afforded us much amusement.</p>

<p>Many people think Mr Taft is reserving some
great pronouncement for Iloilo, as he favoured
this town above all Philippine communities in that
he made here his great pro-Filipino speech, two
years ago, when he was Governor-General of the
Philippines. In this famous oration he used these
words: “These Philippine Islands are going to
be governed <em>for</em> the Filipinos, and no one <em>but</em> the
Filipinos, and any stranger or American who does
not like it can get out.”</p>

<p>This did much to ensure his popularity with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the natives everywhere in the Islands, and in Iloilo
in particular. However, even the easy-going
Americans seem to have grasped that these words
went a little too far, for they tried to hush up that
part of the speech, but the Filipinos, already fully
alive to the blessings of a free press, seized on
this utterance, and it was published in <cite>The Nuevo
Heraldo</cite>, which is the Iloilo <i lang="es">Independiente</i> organ.
The phrase got about everywhere, and did much
to shake public confidence in justice towards the
white man, with incidental harm to trade and
enterprise, but it pleased the “little brown
brother,” and added another step to the pedestal
on which he has placed the Patron Saint.</p>

<p>To the mere observer, however, this cry of
Altruism is not very convincing in face of the fact
that the Philippines lie so conveniently on the west
of the future Panama Canal. It was not brotherly
love which prompted astute American politicians
to wash off the Spaniards with rivers of blood and
treasure, and I think the Filipino will find that he
gets just as much of “Philippines for the Filipinos”
as is contained in the other famous phrase of “little
brown brother”—and no more. Gradually, too,
he will find that to be a “little brown brother” out
here will be the same sort of distinction as being a
big black brother in the U.S.A.</p>

<p>In one of the last magazines we received from
home is a description by some woman of a cruise
in a tramp steamer in the Pacific. Lotus Islands,
and all that sort of thing, and who-wants-to-return-to-fretful-Europe
rhapsodies, which it struck me I
should better have appreciated this time last year.
But now all I think of is the utter, mental sterility
of such a life, which appears to me, in the light of
experience, still more like the impression made by
a beautiful and stupid woman. She winds up
with a fine peroration about the “spell of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Ancient World,” which “binds one to the Island
home and the Island life for ever.”</p>

<p>I can’t think what there is of the “Ancient
World” about a Pacific island; but the spell, if
there is one, must be that of indolence; or the
attraction, as in the case of Stevenson, simply a
matter of health; for it seems to me that no other
inducements could make one willingly lose touch of
all that civilisation has to offer to distinguish one
from a south sea islander. Of course, in the
temperate climes there are the inconveniences of
dress, frost, and drainage, but those are small
when compared with art, books, good music, and
intelligent fellow-creatures. Oh, you can’t imagine
the deadliness of the lives the white people lead
here—the indifference, the stagnation, the animal
round of food and sleep! I think if it had been
my fate to stay on in the “Island home and the
Island life” for ever, if I had not become physically
ill, I must have become mentally an invalid for the
rest of my life.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_41">LETTER XLI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FESTIVITIES</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>August 17, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>I must tell you all about this <i lang="es">Comitiva Taft</i> dissipation,
of which we had the first taste on Monday, the
15th, when a printed notice was left at our house, saying
that the “Congressional party” had arrived that
evening instead of next morning, and another large,
flowery, and handsome invitation, bidding us to
a reception to be held at the house of the De la
Ramos, very rich Filipinos, who have a fine house
in a broad, shady street, where the Bank and some
other big houses stand within gardens.</p>

<p>The reception was to be followed by the performance
at the Filipino theatre, to which as I told
you we had also been invited, but we thought that
the reception, which was “scheduled” to come off
at eight, would be quite enough for us for one
evening.</p>

<p>We dined early, and sent Domingo out for
a <i lang="es">quilez</i> “with a good horse.” He came back
after a long while and said all the carriages in
the town were already hired, but he had got
what he could, and the <i lang="es">caballo</i> was <i lang="es">poco bueno</i>
(little good). He was right. It was a horse to
make one’s heart ache to look at; and when we
stepped into the dirty old broken-down <i lang="es">quilez</i>,
to which he was attached with odds and ends
of old rope, the poor beast started going backwards
all down the street. The driver roared
profanities, and clicked his lips, and chucked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
reins, but all to no effect; till at last he called
one of our servants out of the house, and they
each seized a wheel by the spokes and forced it
round, so that the pony was shoved along, when
it started off at a great pace; the driver sprang
on the box, and we tore like the wind to the
house of De la Ramos.</p>

<p>There had been a great deal of rain, and the
roads were very deep in mud, but the sky had
cleared, and a bright moon was shining.</p>

<p>In spite of this natural illumination, there
was a reckless profusion of arc-lights in the streets,
which, as I told you, had been in black gloom
for months. We had seen the lamps being
repaired for some days when we went out in
the evenings, and the general furbishing-up and
improvement extended to a sudden serving out
of ice from the Government factory, so that everyone
was wishing there could be one of these
Visitations to Iloilo every week. Well, when
we got to the De la Ramos house, we found all
the front really extremely pretty, with <em>huge</em> stars-and-stripes
flags—stripes the size of palm-trunks
and stars like soup-plates—draped right across the
front, with green palm-branches stuck about, all in
the light of brilliant illuminations. Great doors
stood open to a vast lighted and decorated hall,
with a very big cut-glass chandelier in the middle.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">poco bueno</i> horse was pulled up on his
haunches abruptly in front of all this magnificence,
and some white men leaning against the doorway
picking their teeth, looked at us, but offered no
remark. So C——, in evening dress, got out
and asked one of them if this was the house
where the reception was to take place. One
man, keeping his toothpick in his mouth, said:</p>

<p>“Waal I guess there is <em>naht</em> going to be any
great shakes of a reception <em>to</em>-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said C——, “we got an invitation
from the Reception Committee, and heard the
<i>Manchuria</i> had come in.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, sirree,” said the man, “but
Secretary Taft and Miss Alice is not coming
ashore; leastways, they’re on board now eating
their dinners.”</p>

<p>“Will they go to the theatre, then?” we asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said the man vaguely, “I guess naht.
Leastways, I don’t rightly know. But Secretary
Taft says he don’t want to come ashore before
his skeddled time to-morrow morning. I reckon
he’s gettin’ a bit sick of goin’ around.”</p>

<p>The man was quite civil, but he and his
fellow-loungers were so vague and depressing
that we drove away again, feeling rather sorry
we had taken the trouble to put on evening dress.</p>

<p>We made our driver go down the end of the
street to the quay by the Customs landing, where
there was a very pretty arch, all lighted up, with
portraits painted on it of Mr Roosevelt, and “Miss
Alice,” and Mr Taft. This had been erected by
the Filipinos, and the decorations, which were the
work of a native artist, were really not at all
discreditable. Across Calle Real was another arch,
put up by the Chinese, at the entrance to where
their shops begin, with more electric lights and
pictures of angels, and more medallions of Mr
Roosevelt, with an entirely different face from the
Customs one, and “Miss Alice” looking about
thirty, with fat, red cheeks and masses of
black hair.</p>

<p>After admiring these marvels, and noticing
what could be seen of the decorations on the
houses, we drove home and consoled our hearts
very successfully with cold mutton—a treat from the
Cold Storage in Manila—which would have made up
to us for anything. You see, you can’t have cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
meat in this climate without ice to cool it on, and
we have been without ice for so many wretched
months. Faddy people should be sent to Iloilo to
learn to say a fervid and completely heart-whole
grace before cold mutton, and I often think out
here of the delicious cold meat which our servants
at home may be, at that very moment, refusing
to eat!</p>

<p>Next day we were awakened by a brass band
walking up and down the streets, and blowing
Sousa and “Hiawatha” for all it was worth. It
was not yet dawn when this festivity began, so
after we had sworn at them, we went to sleep again,
for the music did not mean that anything was
happening, beyond that its playing was a sort of
general rouse-out and reminder. We had been
informed that the reception was to be held at the
<i lang="es">Gobierno</i> soon after the party landed, so, as we
determined to bring this function to bay somehow,
we sallied forth after breakfast to see what was to
be seen.</p>

<p>A <i lang="es">quilez</i> was not to be had for love or money,
nor, indeed, a “rig” of any sort, so we walked to
the Plaza, and in the Calle Real picked up a
<i lang="es">carromata</i>—one of the fearful little vehicles into
which you climb over a muddy wheel and sit
jammed up behind the driver.</p>

<p>After sending back Sotero, who had followed to
look for a <i lang="es">quilez</i> for us, and making him carry
away Tuyay, who insisted on not leaving us, we got
into the <i lang="es">carromata</i> and drove down the crowded
streets to the <i lang="es">Gobierno</i>.</p>

<p>All the houses were very gay with stars and
stripes and greenery—the decorations very little
spoilt by the rain—and the streets full of people in
clean clothes; all the principal thoroughfares
crowded, but the others very empty.</p>

<p>The day, which had begun with rain, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
cleared up, and was very fresh and jolly, as it had
not yet had time to get steamy, and a cool breeze
was blowing, the flags fluttered in the sun, bands
were playing everywhere, and it was all very gay
and sparkling. In one of the streets we began to
pass a long procession, waiting behind the scenes,
as it were, with flags unfurled and bands ready to
strike up.</p>

<p>There were crowds and crowds of people
making for the palace, and we were told that the
<i lang="es">Comitiva Taft</i> had already landed and driven
there, so we followed as best we could. There was
a great deal of shouting of <i lang="es">Tabé</i>—and we were as
near as anything over some of the revellers who
were mooning about as if the streets were deserted.</p>

<p>By-the-bye, I don’t know whether this expression
<i lang="es">Comitiva Taft</i> is bad Spanish or good Filipino,
but it is the one employed by the Philippine
newspapers, and I prefer it to the American “Taft
Circus.”</p>

<p>When we arrived at the <i lang="es">Gobierno</i>, we found
large crowds of little, brown-faced Filipinos in
white American suits, all looking up at the broad
balcony—the one where the band had played
on the night of the 4th-of-July ball. The whole
expanse of balcony was full of people, with many
ladies standing in front in light frocks and big
flat hats.</p>

<p>We struggled through the crowd of sight-seers
and into the big basement, which was decorated
very profusely, and where a lot of people were
standing about. A man told us he guessed the
reception was going on upstairs; and we thought
perhaps he had guessed correctly, so we mounted
the broad stairs, between sheaves of palms and
American flags, and found ourselves in a huge
crowd in the outer room of the suite I described
to you the night of the ball. The court room had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
been arranged with rows of chairs and benches
facing the daïs, and the balcony beyond, with the
bright blue sky and white glare of sunlight for a
background, was a seething mass of white-clad
humanity. I noticed the Americans were all at
one end and the Filipinos at the other—an arrangement
of choice, I imagine, rather than accident.</p>

<p>Amongst the visitors I met again Mrs Luke
E. Wright, and several other people whose acquaintance
I had made in Manila, as the party had been
nearly doubled by the numbers absorbed into it
after arriving in the Philippines. My friends said
they had heard I was ill, and that I was going
home, and envied me, calling heaven to witness
that they wished they were going “back home”
too. The Governor’s secretary told me that the
party now amounted to 170 people, and they had
a very jolly time on board, and were expecting to
have a very pleasant trip round the Islands.</p>

<p>There was no regular presenting being done,
and no one offered to introduce us to Mr Taft or
“Miss Alice,” and we did not like to ask them to
do so, which I am sorry about now, as I should have
liked to have met them. However, Miss Alice was
standing next to the Governor’s wife while I was
talking to the latter, so I was able to get an impression
of her appearance, which I thought quite
pleasing; a young girl with a fluff of fair hair tied
behind with a big bow of black ribbon, a very pale
complexion, and heavily-lidded blue eyes. She had
on a coat and skirt of stiff white pique, which did
not do justice to her pretty figure, and a plain
straw hat with blue ribbons on it tilted over her
forehead.</p>

<p>All the American ladies amongst the visitors
were very plainly dressed in shirts and skirts, as
for the country in the morning, with large, flat hats
and floating gauze veils—just like the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
tourists you see in London out of the season. The
residents, however, had on pretty muslins and hats,
and the Filipino ladies sported their most beautiful
<i lang="es">camisas</i> and finest jewels. I heard afterwards that
the very plain costumes of the visitors were considered
as rather a poor compliment, not to say a
mistake in tact, for of course the Manila papers had
given glowing accounts of the lovely dresses they
wore at the entertainments in Manila, and Orientals
think such a lot of that sort of thing—and so do
Occidentals, too, for the matter of that!</p>

<p>Mr Taft and the Senators were all in white
linen suits; the officers in white linen, too, plus
the badges of their rank. Mr Taft, who is a
very tall, fair man of enormous build, towered
over the heads of everyone about him. I don’t
think I ever saw anyone so vast, and could quite
believe that he weighed 250 pounds—though I
must say that to hear a weight expressed in pounds
does not convey much impression to my mind.
He has a large, clever face, which creases up into
an amiable smile for which he is famous, and
which has helped him enormously in life. In
curious contrast are his eyes, which are small, and
placed rather close together, and very shrewd in
expression. When he is serious, it is a stern, rather
hard face, and not very pre-possessing, but when
he smiles the “Taft smile,” it is altered in the
most extraordinary manner, and he really looks
charming.</p>

<p>After we had been on the balcony a little time,
the procession began to come into sight, headed by
a brass band. At this the people on the balcony
sorted themselves out, Mr Taft and “Miss Alice”
standing in the front of the balcony with the chief personages
behind them, and less important Americans
in the doorways and on the outskirts, all in the most
approved “democratic” style, while the brown faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
all clustered at the other end of the balcony. I
thought it a great pity that it did not occur to Mr
Taft, or Miss Roosevelt, or the Governor, or anyone
like that to go and stand amongst the Filipinos and
give a real and tangible demonstration of the theories
they were there to express. I did not see anyone
talking to the visitors but Americans, either, and
I thought that a pity too.</p>

<p>You see, a little thing like that would convey
more truth about Equality than miles of bombastic
print or hours of windy rhetoric.</p>

<p>The Governor’s secretary found me a place in
front of the balcony, but I was foolish enough to
move away for a moment to speak to someone, and
so lost my place. Then we saw that people were
beginning to stand on the benches, so C—— got
me a place on one by asking some men to move,
which they were rather huffy about. On one side
of me was a tall, thin young Senator with a large
hand-camera, who showed his resentment in tiresome
little incivilities; but the man on the other
side was a nice, good-natured soul, who tried to
make room for me, and spoke very agreeably. He
seemed to be feeling the heat very much, and complained
that it was so fearfully hot, but I laughed
and said: “This is the coolest day we have had
for a long time.”</p>

<p>“My!” he exclaimed, “I guess I’m not fair
crazy to come and live in these old Phaluppeens.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, “then you have not joined the
party at Manila?”</p>

<p>He said he had come from America all the way,
and told us he was a newspaper man with a
mission, come to write up the trip. This made us
understand better his asking from time to time
such extraordinarily elementary questions. He
wanted to know what a <i lang="es">carabao</i> was, and was
surprised to hear that sugar cane only flourished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
in Panay and Negros. I had to explain to him
that we were in Panay, and pointed out Negros
and Guimaras!</p>

<p>I did not grudge the trouble of teaching him
the A B C of the Philippines, but I could not help
thinking it rather odd that he had no more
preparation for his mission when his opinions
would probably be “voiced” and quoted as oracles
on his return to “God’s Country.”</p>

<p>Of course he was choke full of long words
about the American Ideal, and told me a lot about
the absurdity of such narrow prejudice as race-distinctions;
but I let that go without remark, and
without even taking the trouble to draw his
attention to the demonstrations before his eyes;
for I have found out by this time that you might
as well talk to the wind as to a race-equality
American who won’t sit “on a car” with a negro
in the States.</p>

<p>C——, who was standing behind me, joined in the
conversation, whereupon the American journalist
instantly whipped out his visiting card and handed
it to him, but of course C—— was quite unprepared,
and had to spell his name and explain himself
generally. It is very amusing, and at first rather
embarrassing, the way Americans hand you a card
as soon as you speak, but it has its advantages in
getting names right.</p>

<p>The procession was remarkably like the one we
had seen on Declaration Day, only with different
“floats.” I don’t suppose you know what “floats”
are, and no more did I, for when I had read
descriptions of the processions in Manila, and
how the “floats” were “gotten up,” I concluded
the function had been a water-pageant on the
Pasig. I heard some people about me using the
same word, however, and mentioned it to my
journalistic friend, who informed me that the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
was one which was employed in the U.S.A. to
signify cars in a procession, and that its origin was
in New Orleans, where they had processions on the
river with decorated “floats” or rafts.</p>

<p>This was a very long procession, and some of
the agricultural cars were prettily done up with
banana plants, and one had sugar canes growing in
it; and there were ploughs, and rows of men
carrying spades and hoes and things. Mr Taft
stood and watched it all, talking to Miss Roosevelt;
but he got what the children call a good deal of
powder in his spoonful of jam, in the shape of huge
white banners with large inscriptions on them about
the financial situation and the tariffs. Some of
these reminders were of a very ingenious pattern,
like huge three-sided lanterns, with the inscription
in English, Spanish, and Visayan, so that no one
should make any mistake about what was meant.
“A square deal” was written on one, and some of
them were, to me, quite pathetic, for they said:
“We are at your mercy,” and others were frank,
not to say abrupt, requests for liberty, “to govern
ourselves our own way.”</p>

<p>At all these and at the strings of labourers
from the Harbour Works, the Fire Brigade, etc.,
Mr Taft stared very solemnly and steadily, standing
upright in front of the balcony, with Miss Roosevelt
beside him, his arms folded across his chest. I
was much struck by his expression, and could not
help looking at him as much as at the procession
and wondering what he really thought of it all.
When the workmen came past, our journalist friend
suddenly betrayed his knowledge of Philippine
affairs by saying knowingly: “Ah, these are the
Chinese labourers, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No,” said C——. “Those are Filipinos. There
are no Chinese labourers in the Philippines except
in some mills in Luzon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>This information apparently took the man’s
breath away; if he believed it, which he probably
did not. He was quite silent for a long time.
Perhaps some of his most elaborate perorations had
been damaged, and C—— and I thought afterwards
that it was rather a pity we had disillusioned the poor
creature as we did. Another of his cherished illusions
was what I may call the St Louis “Exposition”
idea of the Philippines, and we had the greatest difficulty
in trying to persuade him that all he saw was
not the direct result of the American occupation!</p>

<p>At last the interminable lines of school children
came past—all the Government schools, of course—as
on Declaration Day; no priests or convents.
Mr Taft had looked on unmoved and unsmiling
at the Agricultural and Industrial displays, but
when he saw these scholars, he broke into the
“Taft smile,” and clapped his hands above his
head. All the Americans followed his lead by
bursting into applause, which they kept up, as he
did, all the time the schools were passing. I
turned my head to the right, where the little brown
parents of these children were crowded together,
and saw that not one single Filipino made one
gesture of applause!</p>

<p>The schools took a long, long time to crawl
past, and the continuous applause became rather
tiring. But even a Filipino procession must come
to an end if only you can wait long enough, and
the last of them went past, and we got down off our
bench.</p>

<p>Then followed a great surging and shifting of
all the people on the balcony, everyone trying to
secure a seat in the Court Room, and we were
lucky enough to get near a door and not very far
from the front.</p>

<p>On the daïs were placed two or three rows of
Vienna cane chairs, those for the important people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
in front, with arms to them. In these sat the
Governor, Mrs Luke E. Wright, and “Miss Alice.”
Next to the latter Mr Taft took the chair assigned
to him, into which he wedged himself with infinite
trouble; but the chair at once broke to pieces.
Everyone laughed very much, Mr Taft most heartily
of all, saying in a good-natured, jolly way: “Here!
Someone give me a chair I can sit down on. I’m
tired of standing.”</p>

<p>So they brought him another chair, and he took
his place, and the speechifying began.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">Presidente</i> of Iloilo—a very courtly old
Filipino of the name of Meliza—made a speech of
welcome—a very long affair—which included the
subjects of Taxation, Duties, and Independence, to
which Mr Taft replied elusively, repeating nothing
tangible but his old phrase of “Philippines for the
Filipinos.”</p>

<p>Then some more people made speeches—natives—and
at last they drove Mr Taft into a corner
about the Independence, and he said, “I am not
come to give you your Independence, but to study
your welfare. You will have your Independence
when you are ready for it, which will not be in this
generation—no, nor in the next, nor perhaps for a
hundred years or more.”</p>

<p>Even though I have told you how up to then no
one had any idea of why he and his party had come
to the Islands—most people thinking he was going
to say something definite about the Americans
retiring from the Islands—the natives all firmly convinced
that he was coming to ratify the undated
promise of Independence he made them two years
ago—even though I have told you this, you can
have no idea of the effect these words had upon the
audience. We were simply staggered, and the
darker complexioned amongst us sat quite still and
immovable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>The speeches lost some of their force by being
translated as they went along by an interpreter,
who spoke English and Spanish with equal perfection,
and, indeed, he was quite marvellous; but
all the same the utterances lost point, and it was
not easy to follow the thread with long halts
between. What was more serious was that the
translations of Mr Taft’s opinions were softened
by the courteous Spanish phrases, and the fiery
patriotism of the Filipinos was marvellously toned
down in the English rendering.</p>

<p>During a question of taxation, Mr Taft said:</p>

<p>“I want to know if you think it would be any
good to reduce the Land Tax, or if, by suspending
it for three years, the trade and agriculture of the
country would benefit?”—or words to that effect.
Whereupon he and old Señor Meliza had quite a
long argument about this weighty point.</p>

<p>The whole ceremony was indescribably free and
easy, and even commonplace. Most of the Senators
took very little interest in the proceedings, while
the ladies with them did not even pretend to care
about what was going on. As to “Miss Alice,”
she was honest enough to make no pretence at all
of listening to anything, but sat staring before her,
drumming with her pretty, slender, white fingers on
her lips, only waking up to signal and laugh to some
friends in a doorway near the platform. She was
very girlish and natural in this and in all her
other gestures, and if she lacked the pose necessary
to the occasion, one could not be too critical nor
take objection to her lack of grand manner when
people were presented to her, for, after all, such
situations are only to be carried off with ease by
those born and bred to State ceremonies. Besides,
it would have been unreasonable to have looked for
scrupulously aristocratic bearing amongst such a
party of professed democrats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of all that, however, the Filipinos, who,
with their traditions of <i lang="es">custumbres</i>, are themselves a
very polite people, were much shocked by the free
and easy ways of their rulers, benefactors, or
whatever they are. I afterwards heard many little
comments upon the American lack of dignity, which
made me feel sad, for these two peoples will never
understand each other—even the good sentiments
of the heart being conveyed by differences of
manner, which are meat to one and poison to the
other.</p>

<p>In talking of taxation, the word “sugar”
suddenly arose, on which Mr Taft, who was
getting obviously bored, and mopping his face
freely, rose and said:</p>

<p>“See here. We’ve come to this place to talk
about sugar. Now, look here, have you got any
room where the gentlemen who are with me can
meet your representatives? They would like to see
a sugar plantation growing, too, if you can show
them one.”</p>

<p>The Filipinos said they thought that could be
arranged, and, as a matter of fact, the hall for this
confabulation was already prepared, and the growing
cane ready as well.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Mr Taft. “All I care
about is to get out of this room and get some of
that nice cool wind on me!” He looked simply
<em>melting</em>. So everyone rose up, and Mr Taft gave
out that Mrs Carter, the wife of the General,
invited the ladies of the party to luncheon with her
at her house “on” the Calle Real at one o’clock.
Then everyone filed away, and we went home to
rest before the evening. It was then half-past
eleven—very late for this country—and the sun
very hot.</p>

<p>I was afterwards told about the ladies’ luncheon
party. It only consisted of the visitors, most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
whom were already personal friends of Mrs Carter,
so, of course, it was not an important function.
Here, again, I thought, was a golden opportunity
wasted, for a few invitations extended to leading
Filipino and <i lang="es">Mestiza</i> ladies would have done more
good to the American cause than all the utterances
of the cleverest orators.</p>

<p>In the evening we went, in the usual pantomime
<i lang="es">quilez</i>, to the Santa Cecilia Club, where the Filipino
banquet to Mr Taft and his <i lang="es">Comitiva</i> was to be held.
Or at least, that was the official description of the
entertainment for which, as I told you, we each
paid a preposterous sum.</p>

<p>The whole building was ablaze with lights and
bunting, while the familiar perilous medley of
vehicles surged about in the mud outside, with
hairbreadth escapes going on every minute, any
one of which would have made the fortune of a
clever paragraphist.</p>

<p>The top of the stairs, the big landing, and
outer place, were crowded with people, but the main
room was still comparatively empty, so when
we went in we had a good chance of seeing the
decorations and tables. The latter were most
ingeniously arranged to form the letters ILOILO,
with a long table for the first I, then two long
ones each with an elbow to make a sort of
flat O, and then another long one with a long
elbow for L, “and repeat,” as they say in knitting
patterns. The only attempt at decoration was
a mass of greenery all down the middle of
each table, lying flat on the cloth, with oranges
and <i lang="es">lanzone</i> fruits lying on it, and salted pistachio
nuts all thrown about anyhow. By each plate
lay a small spray of flowers (gardenias, little roses
etc.), a list of the guests, with a plan of the tables
and the <i lang="fr">menu</i>, which was a small blue paper
book with a <i lang="fr">nouveau art</i> picture of a woman on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the cover. On the back of this <i lang="fr">menu</i> was printed
in large, clear type these words: “La situacion
di Filipinas es como La de un enfermo que necesita
una radical y eficaz medicacion. La supresion de la
Tarifa Dingley es la mejor medicacion para Filipinas.”
The interpretation of which is: “The situation
of the Philippines is like that of a sick person
for whom a radical and efficacious remedy is
necessary. The suppression of the Dingley Tariff
is the best medicine for the Philippines.”</p>

<p>This <i lang="fr">menu</i> amused me a good deal, with
the idea that poor long-suffering Mr Taft was
to have politics written on everything he saw
or touched, and certainly the Filipinos did not
appear to be going to let slip any of this golden
opportunity of “voicing” their grievances. The
room was lighted by electric lights on the ceiling,
arranged in the form of letters, spelling Taft on
one side of the room and Visayas on the other,
and flags, palm-branches, and paper roses were
employed in the usual profusion.</p>

<p>The people dropped in gradually, and when
the Taft party arrived, Mr Taft took his place at
the middle of the first L, under the picture of
Washington. The rest of the party were scattered
up and down the tables anyhow, with no scheme
of precedence, which was very sensible, and the
first tangible display of democratic principles I
have seen since we came to the Philippines.</p>

<p>About 258 guests were “scheduled,” and less
than three-quarters of the places filled. When
I looked round the hall, I saw that the English
and Germans were fairly well represented; but
there were very few Spaniards, only about half
a dozen Filipinos, some <i lang="es">Chino-Mestizos</i>, and one
or two Eurasian ladies in lovely <i lang="es">camisas</i>, and wearing
magnificent diamonds. All the rest were
Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone seemed disappointed that Miss
Roosevelt did not put in an appearance at the
banquet. The rumour went about that she was
too tired with the morning’s fatigues to be able
to go out again. Afterwards I heard this discussed,
when some said that “Miss Alice” was
not at all strong, and that the round of gaieties
in Manila had worn her out; while others declared
that she always shirked the serious side of the
trip if she could possibly do so; but I don’t
expect the latter theory was true, and I thought
it rather a shame of her country folk to say it.</p>

<p>The feast began with tinned <i lang="fr">julienne</i>, the
Constabulary band playing at the side, in the
outer room, with a vigour which quite relieved
one of any necessity for conversation. I examined
my list of guests and plan of the tables to find
out who the people were, and saw that all the blank
places were those of Filipinos! Fancy! Their
welcome to their Patron Saint! But he had so
disappointed them by his avowed sentiments at
the reception at the <i lang="es">Gobierno</i> in the morning
that very few of them could be induced to come to
the banquet.</p>

<p>As far as eating went, the banquet was a
haphazard affair, for it was almost impossible
to persuade the dazed Filipino waiters to attend
to one. At least, they did attend, but in a very
Filipino way, for I got four bottles of white
wine brought me; C—— had never a taste of
soup; and we both had three plates of fish put
down before us, which the people on each side
took away, as they could not get any at all.
Everyone was very good-natured, so it was all
very amusing.</p>

<p>There was considerable liberty of conscience
displayed in the costumes of the guests, some of the
American men being in soiled white day suits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
conducting female relations in high cotton blouses;
while others were got up in full evening dress.
One handsome woman, who I heard was the wife
of an officer in Camp Josman, was so much in
evening dress, possibly to make up for the others
in the blouses, that she was instantly nick-named
The Mermaid. Her finely shaped head was
dressed very low, and set off by classic bands of
gold, with huge bunches of flowers and ribbons
over each ear, and I heard a man near me suggest
to another that someone should go and ask her
to take some of the ornaments out of her <i lang="fr">coiffure</i>
and put them round her bodice. But no one had
the courage to do this thing, so the little <i lang="es">Mestiza</i>
ladies stared and giggled, and as for the few
Orientals present, they looked at the Mermaid as
if they thought Equality was going to be great
fun.</p>

<p>When we were just about to fall on some beef
<i lang="fr">à la mode</i> which had at last, after incredible
pertinacity on the part of C——, been placed
before us, a man at one of the tables behind us
suddenly got up and began to make a speech.
Everyone slewed their heads round to see him,
and forgot the beef, which the waiters instantly
fell upon and swept away beyond recall.</p>

<p>The speechmaker proposed a health, which we
drank in very good red or white wine provided for us,
and then he made a speech, and someone—one of
the visiting party, I think—got up and replied.</p>

<p>After him, another got up. But many people
listened to him and still held on to their helping of
turkey, which they tried to eat as noiselessly as
possible; a most amusing sight.</p>

<p>Then another; and another; popping up in all
sorts of places, with the interpreter appearing
suddenly beside them like a harlequin. Some of
the speeches, in spite of the halting of the translation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
were very good, and very interesting; for the
speakers did not mince matters much—the natives
saying things very plainly, and the Americans
replying with equal frankness.</p>

<p>Next me at table sat a Filipino swell in
European evening dress, with splendid diamonds
on his hands and in his embroidered shirt front,
who turned his chair round when the speeches
began, and sat astride, leaning on the back. He
cleared his throat, and spat on the floor in such a
dreadful manner that I felt sick, and at last I
turned quite faint, and had to get up and move to
an empty place further on. There I was not so
well off, as far as hearing went, for the head of the
next table was occupied by a cheery party of
“prominent citizens,” Senators, and officers, who
were drinking champagne and making a horrible
noise.</p>

<p>I moved again, this time to a doorway at
the upper end of the hall, where a polite young
<i lang="es">Mestizo</i> offered me his chair; so I ended in being
very well off as to a place, and heard and saw very
well.</p>

<p>An old Senator with a venerable beard was
making a long speech on the subject of freedom
and the folly of race-distinction. In defence of
the latter theory, he rather rashly quoted Tennyson,
repeating the lines about “Saxon and Norman
and Dane are we,” which could not be applied
in the remotest way to either Americans or
Filipinos and came out pure gibberish in the
translation.</p>

<p>To him replied the editor of one of the Iloilo
papers, a small, full-blooded Filipino, with sharp,
clever features. He made a most fiery and
eloquent speech, in which, with angry brown face,
and clenched fists thumping the back of the chair
on which he leant, he declared that the Philippine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Islands had been discovered as long as America,
and that the Filipinos had the same spirit as that
which had caused the Americans to revolt from
England.</p>

<p>He got fearfully excited, and called God to
witness that his people were only asking for their
rights in wishing to have this foreign burden
removed; he and they demanded, insisted on, their
Independence! When he sat down, the waiters
and the band, and the Filipino spectators who had
strolled in, all applauded frantically.</p>

<p>The applause, by-the-bye, was most instructive,
for the American speeches were applauded to the
echo with shouts by the Americans; but the
Filipinos and <i lang="es">Mestizos</i> received the Spanish translations
in <em>utter</em> silence. On the other hand, the
brown folk roared with applause over their own
speakers, and the Americans did not take the
least notice of the English translations. It was
a most odd and unique scene.</p>

<p>Last of all came Mr Taft, who spoke better,
more clearly, and more simply than any of the
others, and my only regret was that such a splendid
delivery should have been impeded by the interpretations.</p>

<p>He repeated all the things he had said in the
morning at the <i lang="es">Gobierno</i>, walking even more
boldly up to the Independence question, and
saying that the people would be given their
Independence when they were worthy of it, which
was the sacred duty of the American people, who
had received these Islands as a Trust from God.</p>

<p>This was received with rapturous ovations by
his countrymen, but the translation was taken in
absolute and embarrassing silence—all but two or
three hisses!</p>

<p>He went on to expound the theory of educating
the Filipino people up to Western ideals, and laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
great stress upon the dignity and power of labour—“and
you must work with your hands—your
hands!”—thunders of applause from the white
men. Absolute silence after the translation. For
my part, I can’t say I felt much carried away by
these phrases when I recollected the speaker’s
attitude towards manual labour and book-learning
a few hours before.</p>

<p>When they were on a level with the free races,
“in a hundred years, perhaps three hundred, four
hundred, they would be worthy to stand and face
the nations”—or something like that. He also
said that he had certainly promised the Filipinos
Independence, and he was not going back upon
his words, no—he was come to uphold—to ratify
them. “Dear Wards from God,” he called them,
spreading his arms out and smiling the Taft smile,
and saying “that the Philippines were a solemn
trust, and the Americans would not fail in this great
duty towards humanity.”</p>

<p>So these fine words were all they got out of
Mr Taft, and we all rose and trooped out to
find our “rigs.”</p>

<p>At the top of the staircase I met a very
Prominent Citizen, who remarked that this had
been a great occasion for Iloilo; and I said: “Yes,
Mr Taft is a clever man and a brilliant orator.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed my friend, “he made a
<em>vurry fine</em> speech.”</p>

<p>I said: “He spoke a great many truths;
what he said was very straightforward.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the P. C., “but he should have said
all that two years ago.”</p>

<p>And that, I find, is the unanimous verdict of
every class and nationality about Mr Taft’s subtle
and rather tardy interpretation of the promises he
made when he was Governor of the Philippines.</p>

<p>Next evening, when the party had gone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
there was nothing left but to discuss what had
taken place, we were leaning over the balcony when
a Prominent Citizen of our acquaintance came
walking past, and stopped, in the friendly, half-Spanish
fashion of the country, to say good evening
and make a few remarks.</p>

<p>“It was a fine show,” we said.</p>

<p>“Why yes,” he agreed, “I guess the Filipinos
did their best for the <i>Secwar</i>.”</p>

<p>“I think he disappointed them, though,”
said C——.</p>

<p>“Well, I should smile! I guess Secretary
Taft’s the best hated man in these islands now.”</p>

<p>And that, I believe, is the unfortunate truth.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_42">LETTER XLII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WEIGHING ANCHOR</span></h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hotel ——</span>, <span class="smcap">Iloilo</span>, <i>August 22, 1905</i>.</p>

<p>We are up-rooted at last, you see, out of our own
delightful house, and enduring the cooking and
service of the best hotel this place has to afford,
while we wait for the <i>Kai-Fong</i>, which is reported
to be loading hard wood at Cebú.</p>

<p>This is not really such a bad place for Iloilo,
which means that it compares unfavourably in
comfort, cleanliness, and sanitation with a second-class
Commercial in a small town in Spain. However,
I have a very nice big cool room, opening on
to a broad balcony, where little trees and plants
stand in tubs, and that is very agreeable to the eye,
as we are right in the town and not near any
gardens. There are four doors in this room, and
six windows, so that the room is capable of the
necessary draught without which it is impossible to
sleep. So far so good, but the Filipino bed has to
be reckoned with—in this case, a vast four-poster,
with a very handsome piece of carving at each end.
That at the head is particularly beautiful, a very
free and graceful design of leaves, and corn, and
fruit, which I wish I could take home with me.
We took the precaution of bringing our own <i lang="es">petates</i>
and pillows when we left our house, as well as our
own towels, and are continually thankful that we
did so!</p>

<p>It is the chief hotel of Iloilo, as I said before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and therefore frequented by all the Prominent
Citizens and their families, to say nothing of the
military, as many of the officers board here. I
think they must be such good-natured people not
to make any fuss about the dirty linen and unwashed
plates, or the cold and greasy food. I am
afraid we are not so amiable, for we began at once
to have it understood that, as we were paying the
prices of a first-class hotel in London or Paris, we
expected comfort and some cleanliness, and C—— said
very definitely to our waiter that he would
knock him down if he attempted again to hand
things on the wrong side. This cleared the air a
good deal, and when they found we insisted on
having things nice, they did their best for us, and
really they have made us so comfortable that we
are quite patient about the <i>Kai-Fong</i>.</p>

<p>We cleared out of our own house on Friday
(this is Monday), and spent all the following day
making over the furniture to the various people
who came, like Joseph’s brethren, bearing money in
their hands. We were so sorry to see the rooms
dismantled, for we loved that house, and had lived
in it in such comfort, and so well cared for by our
good servants. When C—— paid the latter off, he
gave to each an extra present of money, which
pleased them enormously; and the cook, really
quite sad, said over and over again that he wished
we would take him with us to England, and asked
to be allowed to shake hands with us, which great
honour we permitted. Sotero we have brought
here to wait on us, as we would not allow Filipino
hotel servants into our rooms, of course; but
Domingo has been paid off, though he refuses to
consider himself dismissed, and I believe he is
sleeping in the empty house and standing guard
over our big cases, though no one is likely to run
away with them, as they take about five coolies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
each to move. I begin to realise here what our
openness to the Monsoons meant, for I have just
had to clear out of my bedroom, where I was writing,
and come into the public <i lang="es">sala</i> (which is really
a furnished corridor), because the wind shifted a
little, so that it no longer blew into the bedroom.
By this I mean that when the wind was off me, I
burst into perspiration, my face dripping on to the
paper, my hands as if I had dipped them in water,
my clothes soaking, and my head beginning to ache
and throb. Oh, I can’t find words to express how
thankful I am to be going away from this horrible,
everlasting heat! It gets on one’s nerves not to
be able to move a chair, to walk two yards without
dripping at every pore, and one’s clothes feel so
irksome and heavy. If one takes exercise it is
acute discomfort—if one does not, one is ill!</p>

<p>We are now having the echoes of the <i lang="es">Comitiva Taft</i>
visitation, and it is really most amusing to see how
the popular idol has fallen. Fallen for the Filipinos
that is, for the Americans all think him very
great and “cute” to manage as he has done,
though they are all declaring openly that he should
have said all this two years ago, as our friend
shrewdly observed to us when we were leaving
the banquet. Of course, there is something to be
said for Mr Taft, for if he had made such unpopular
utterances when he was Governor here, his life
would not have been worth two cents a day. All
the same, to the lay mind, such subtle change of
front is not very palatable, and one cannot help
wishing that politicians could afford to say straight
out what they mean, and stick to it for good or
evil.</p>

<p>The papers from Manila with the account of
our festivities have arrived, and I never read such
brazen lying in my life; in fact, the reports are so
cooked that they leave off being annoying and begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to be funny. The wild scenes of popular enthusiasm,
the crowded banquet, the frantic love of the
people of Panay for their idol, and so on, and so
on. And as to sheer reporting, Mr Taft’s speech
(which the Manila people are informed was greeted
by the natives with thunderous applause) is given
at great length, but the impassioned utterances of
the patriot who clutched the chair-back are
dismissed in a few mild words. No mention, too,
of the ominous banners in the procession, of the
note on the back of the <i lang="fr">menu</i> at the banquet, and
not the faintest hint of the one or two hisses which
greeted the sentiments of the <i>Secwar</i> himself. So
much for the local papers. And if that is the way
they dally with truth out here, one can only faintly
wonder what impression of this trip is being
disseminated amongst the intelligent voters in the
far-off U.S.A., by our well-informed journalistic
friend and others of his kidney.</p>

<p>The Iloilo banquet, by-the-bye, wound up rather
disastrously for American dignity, as the rowdy
party at the table near us got up some quarrel with
one of the Filipino waiters; there were blows and
fighting, and the whole lot were chucked out into
the street. This, as you may imagine, has made
a horrible scandal, and produced a very bad
impression.</p>

<p>About the banquet, too, it now appears that
the Filipinos subscribed 70 <i lang="es">pesos</i> towards that and
the general expenses, and the rest of the community,
ourselves included, made the sum up to
the 4000 required, plus a grant from the Treasury.</p>

<p>C—— went to see our poor old Spanish friend
about something a day or two ago (the ex-courtier,
whose visit I think I described to you), and when
C—— said that he had not seen him at the banquet,
the old fellow replied that he had sent the committee
12 <i lang="es">pesos</i> towards the expenses, with a letter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
well-wishing, etc., as he thought it was his duty
to do so, and to contribute what he could.</p>

<p>“Well,” said C——, “but didn’t they answer
with an invitation to the banquet?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the old man, “they did not even
acknowledge the money.”</p>

<p>He seemed rather down on his luck about the
whole thing, and more anxious than ever to sell his
piece of land and go home to Spain to die.</p>

<p>Iloilo is now far away below the horizon astern,
and if I look over the side, I am afforded the delightful
spectacle of one Philippine Island slipping past
after the other into pale blue fluff, and I hope they
will stay down under my horizon for ever.</p>

<p>We scraped out through a network of taxes, like
fish trying to get out of a fish-<i lang="es">corral</i>. Our two
large cases had to get a Customs permit before they
could be put on board, for which they got from us a
<i lang="es">peso</i> in the form of a stamp upon the Export Entry,
and another <i lang="es">peso</i> and a half for what they call
wharfage. This means that they did not examine
the contents of the cases, but gave C—— a paper
to sign and an export permit. Another item is an
Internal Revenue tax of a <i lang="es">peso</i> on each passenger
ticket. Fancy if we at home had to pay 10 shillings
in taxes before we could go across the Channel!</p>

<p>It is so nice to be in such a clean and comfortable
steamer, and to have fresh vegetables and
fruit, brought on ice from Hong Kong; and one
wonders how the Americans can tolerate the
contrast between this and those dreadful Spanish
cockroach-traps which they dignify by the name
of the Mail.</p>

<p>All the crew are Chinese, of course, looking so
straight and tall and intelligent after the stumpy,
stupid, little Filipinos. With them too, as with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Filipino horses, the eye has been thrown out of
focus, for the Chinese simply look colossal. I
keep on thinking to myself what a very tall man
that is, and he is only the usual height of ordinary
men.</p>

<p>Most of the second-class passengers are Chinese,
and they have queer meals on the lower deck, all
squatting round a wooden tray on which are one
or two big bowls of rice and bits of meat and vegetables.
Round these are piled little bowls, into
which the mixture is served out, and the Chinamen
all set to work with chop-sticks, which is so like a
conjuring-trick that one can watch them as long as
they will go on with it! Amongst these people is a
Chinaman with his Filipino wife, a little ugly woman,
with her lips jutting out beyond the end of her nose,
dressed in a gay <i lang="es">camisa</i>, and for ever smoking a
huge, ragged cigar. Some children of theirs cling
to them most of the time, and a very gaudily-dressed
little chap of a more purely Filipino type,
whom the Chinaman is exporting to a friend in
Amoy who has bought the child for 10 dollars.
You can buy children very cheaply in the
Philippines; and away from the big towns, and
very often in them, they are openly offered for
sale; and most of the rich native and <i lang="es">Mestizo</i>
families have servants which have been bought as
children. I daresay, though I have never inquired
about it, that the Americans strenuously deny this
officially, but unofficially it is a perfectly well-known
custom. This small slave was a very
native little chap of three or four, got up in purple
cotton coat and a crimson jockey cap, and radiantly
happy in his new clothes, and we could not really
feel very sorry for him. The Chinamen all take
the greatest care of their hair, combing it out every
day, and some of them have magnificent, glossy,
black locks, right down to their knees; but others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
whose hair is thin and scanty, eke out their pigtails
with long cords of black silk gimp.</p>

<p>Talking of servants, when we came down to the
Muelle Loney (to think I shall never see that
place again!) this morning, we found Domingo
waiting, in his smartest clothes, spotlessly white,
and his skin shining with soap, to see us off. Poor
fellow, he hung round, blubbering quietly, and carrying
anything he could catch hold of, and when he
said good-bye his face was quite pathetic. I think he
felt he was losing the only people in the world who
had ever treated him well, and he was one of the
best specimens of a typical, unspoilt Filipino,
stolid, obedient, humble, and faithful as a dog, and
C—— said he would have given anything to have
been able to take him with us, as the poor creature
implored us to do. At the last, when the launch
was pushing off, Domingo made a wild rush to
spring on board, but was too late; and the last we
saw of him was standing on the quay with his hat
off and the tears streaming down his big, brown
face.</p>

<p>We discussed this rush of Domingo’s, but can
arrive at no satisfactory solution of what he wanted
to do, for I think he only wanted to come out
to the <i>Kai-Fong</i>, but C—— says he is certain he
meant to follow us to Hong Kong and compel us
to take him with us. Well, we can’t do that, but
we have done our best for him in making him from
a rough coolie into a clean, smart servant, who can
get double the wages he received from us; and we
found him a good place before we left, though, as
I said before, I am not at all sure how either he
or the other will do with the impatience and curses
with which the average white man thinks he
impresses his dignity upon the coloured person. It
is not to be done in the Anglo-Indian method; no,
nor in the American extreme of familiarity. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
that I was persuaded before I came here, and
am still more convinced now that I have more
experience.</p>

<p>The only way to impress anyone, black, brown,
<em>or</em> white, with the idea of your dignity, is to be
dignified yourself. But I suppose this is too much
of an obvious truism for anyone to attempt to
think over or act up to. Well, it served me in very
good stead; and all I know is that, though every
soul I spoke to had endless complaints about the
impudence, laziness, or dishonesty of their servants,
whether they were of the nation who kicked them,
or those who allowed them to wear a vest in the
house and not say <i lang="es">señor</i>, we never had any trouble
once we got rid of our first Americanised cook—my
house went as on oiled axles, and we never
missed one single thing from start to finish. So
what am I to say of the Filipinos? Those with
whom I came in contact, as well as my own
servants, were a narrow, cunning, good-humoured
people, vain, superstitious, stupid, great gamblers,
kind to their children, and bitterly cruel to animals—oh,
the poor hens hung up by the heels in the
sun! and the wretched pigs with their four feet
lashed together that used to lie all day scorching
in the Plaza at Molo! the awful open sores under
the harness of the starving ponies! the brutal,
sickening, cock-fighting! For those horrors alone,
I should be thankful to leave this country, even
were it the paradise which it is not. No, no
terrestrial paradise, for one has the laziness, the
heat, the apathy, and cruelty of the East, without
the compensations of artistic beauty, cheapness,
plenty, and luxury, which make up for those drawbacks
in other hot countries. A shuffling, drab, discontented,
thick-headed, costly East—with all the
worst traditions of four hundred years of the off-scourings
of the Spanish monkish orders, overlaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
by a veneer of shallow cock-sureness hastily
assimilated from a totally incongruous alien civilisation.</p>

<p>We carry a cargo of sugar, and from the
ventilators come up gusts of that peculiar, heavy,
nauseous odour, which carries one back instantly to
the <i lang="es">camarins</i> of Iloilo. I can’t believe that the
Philippines are really a thing of the past for me—it
is not that I was there so long; but there was so
little variety, and we saw and did and heard the
same things so often, that I am left with an
impression of as many years as we have been there
months.</p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
